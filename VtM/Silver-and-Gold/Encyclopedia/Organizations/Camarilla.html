<p>The Camarilla is one of the two mains sects of vampires (the other one being the Sabbat). Although not all vampires are members of one of these two sects, the majority are, if only in a de facto sense. The Camarilla maintains the Six Traditions, the most important of these being the first one, that of protecting the Masquerade. In fact, this is the binding thread of the Clans that claim Camarilla membership.</p>
<p>Why is the Masquerade so important to Kindred in the Camarilla? Although vampires of any generation are powerful (and the eldest of the Kindred akin to gods), humans have the weight of greater numbers, vast resources, and an unhindered ability to move around during the daylight hours. Any Cainite in the 19th century is the match for perhaps 10 humans; few, however, could defeat 10,000.</p>
<p>The second, less obvious item that holds this sect together is the need for population control, accomplished primarily through the distribution of power (although some would hold that the Camarilla Inner Circle instead maintains power <i>by</i> the exercise of population control).</p>
<h3>Organization - Sect</h3>
<p>The Camarilla is run by the Inner Circle, which consists of the “eldest” of the elders of each the seven clans that have pledged fidelity to the Camarilla: Brujah, Gangrel, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere, and Ventrue. In addition to setting policy and making decisions for the Camarilla, the Inner Circle appoint the Justicars.</p>
<p>The seven Justicars are the eyes, ears, hands, and fangs of the Inner Circle. Justicars are without a doubt the most powerful members of the Camarilla, including perhaps the Inner Circle. A Justicar's actions can only be challenged by another Justicar or by unanimous decree of the Inner Circle. Justicars alone can pass final decision on an alleged breach of the Traditions, and may call a Conclave either alone (to sit in judgement against a Cainite) or with a peer (to interpret sect policy).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Archons are the minions of the Justicars. They are appointed and dismissed by individual Justicars at need, some serving multiple Justicars over a long period of time, and some whose appointment last for a single act of service. By tradition, Justicars appoint Archons not of their own clan; also by tradition, the new Archon is blood-bonded to the Justicar they serve.</p>
<h3>Organization - Region</h3>
<p>Regions controlled by the Camarilla (frequently called Kingdoms, Principalities, Duchies, or the like) are usually ruled by a Prince. The following are titles and positions that are common to nearly all Camarilla domains.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Prince</u></strong></p>
<p>The Prince is the preeminent vampire of a Camarilla region. Some Princes are tyrants or absolute monarchs of the Damned while others are politically feeble puppets propped up by more powerful supporters, but the position of Prince is one acknowledged and (sometimes grudgingly) respected by all vampires, even those not of the Camarilla.</p>
<p>A Prince’s duties and privileges are many, but the most important is the interpretation and enforcement of the Traditions, particularly the Masquerade. &nbsp;Her word is law in her domain, which extends so far as she has the might or influence to back it up. So long as the other Kindred of the domain respect the Prince’s authority, the Prince may render a verdict on any matter involving the Traditions, up to and including another Kindred’s claim to the Blood. Everything from censure to declaring a Blood Hunt is at the Prince’s disposal. Beyond that, a Prince has any individual powers he can claim and uphold, such as declaring Elysium, calling a Blood Hunt, adjudicating disputes between residents of his domain, the right to claim a blood-tribute, and potentially even the right to name, ignore, or even disband the Primogen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prince enjoys six specific privileges:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right to Progeny: The Prince may freely create progeny. All other Kindred, regardless of status, must first obtain permission from the Prince before siring a childe. A Kindred who creates childer without the permission of the Prince risks punishment; the Prince may destroy the Childe or even the offending Kindred, or a host of lesser forms of discipline.</li>
  <li>Protection of the Elders: Camarilla Clan Elders (including the Primogen) will generally support the Prince.</li>
  <li>Political Power in the Camarilla: The Prince of a region has status among the Camarilla. Princes can expect to be accorded great respect and to be heard by clan elders even in other cities, with Princes of extremely large regions being accorded the status equivalent of a mortal head of state of a superpower.</li>
  <li>Control over domain: Kindred who come to a Camarilla controlled region are expected to introduce themselves to the Prince, although the specifics vary from region to region. In some regions, this introduction may be no more than a letter delivered to the Prince; in others, the newly-arrived Kindred is supposed to immediately seek out the Prince and present themselves. However, in most areas, the new Kindred shall attend the first gathering at Elysium following their arrival and announce themselves then. It is incumbent on the arriving Kindred to know the rules; ignorance is rarely accepted as an excuse. The Prince has the right to refuse entry of a new arrival.</li>
  <li>Feeding: The Prince has the right to limit or restrict feeding grounds and / or from whom Kindred may feed. As this is usually done on grounds of preserving the Masquerade, breaking this rule can have drastic consequences for the violator.</li>
  <li>Domain over Thine Enemies: The Prince, and technically only the Prince, may call a Blood Hunt against any Kindred whom the Prince determines has broken one or more Traditions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Primogen</u> </strong>(collectively “The Primogen”)</p>
<p>Primogen is a flexible title. In many domains, a Primogen is simply the eldest and most influential Kindred of a given Clan. In others, a Primogen is a member of a council of advisors to the Prince. In some domains, Princes appoint the Primogen (and they may even appoint multiple Primogen of the same Clan, to keep that Clan divided) while in other cities, Primogen arise from among the most powerful members of that Clan or as a result of Clan politics. This is perhaps the most difficult of Camarilla titles for a new Kindred to understand. Just who is appointed to the Primogen (and who makes those appointments) can tell a canny Cainite much about the organization of a Camarilla-controlled region, as well as the strength of the Prince and the Clans. The most frequent number of members of the Primogen is seven (as many members as there are clans in the Camarilla) and similarly, it is typical for each clan to have a single representative. However, powerful Princes sometimes refuse to allow a particular clan to seat a member.</p>
<p>The Primogen has access to the Prince and counsels her on matters of domain importance. Primogen &nbsp;may force a Prince to recognize a vote on a topic of personal significance — though this must typically be done in Elysium or while the Prince’s court is in session, unless the Prince is willing to convene a special hearing. In most regions, the Primogen's power is a distant second to that of the Prince, as their membership rarely can reach consensus. In some regions, however, the Prince and the Primogen are much closer in relative strength and influence, and in a very few, the Prince is a puppet that governs at the whim of the Primogen.</p>
<p><strong><u>The</u> <u>Seneschal</u></strong></p>
<p>The Seneschal is the Prince’s right-hand agent. The title itself is liquid, and has different responsibilities in different domains. In some cases, a Seneschal has little actual power, and is more of an honorific title intended to exalt a peer or grant Status to a trusted aide. In other cases, the Seneschal wields as much or even more power than the Prince himself, issuing decrees, rendering judgment, and enforcing the Traditions himself. A Seneschal is meant to be a chamberlain, a second-in-command and an advisor to the Prince. At any time, he may be asked to step into the prince’s place if she leaves town on business, abdicates or is slain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Prince decides which of his own duties and privileges belong to the Seneschal. In the case that a Prince is unable to make a declaration of the Seneschal’s powers, the Seneschal may claim any Princely privilege until the Prince refutes it (or until a new Prince excuses a Seneschal from her role). Naturally, a Prince wishes to have final authority on such an important position, and many have fought endlessly with their Primogen over the subject.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The</u> <u>Chancellor</u></strong></p>
<p>The Chancellor maintains records of prestation, defining who has pledged what to whom. In some very conservative domains, the Chancellor reads the roll of domain debts before any official gathering of the city's Kindred, so that the state of Kindred obligations is made known to all.</p>
<p>The Chancellor has final say over the validity or satisfaction of a boon. If a Chancellor declares a boon satisfied or still owed, the debt still exists, and any challenge to that debt held either by the debtor or the debt-holder must be settled with the Chancellor or the Prince.</p>
<p><strong><u>Sheriff</u></strong></p>
<p>The Sheriff is responsible for the physical enforcement of Princely decrees. Some Sheriffs are diligent masters-at-arms while others are thuggish, bloody fuckheads who abuse their authority to torment those beneath their station. Most sheriffs are appointed by the Prince and approved by the Primogen. Sheriffs may select deputies (called “Hounds”) to assist them, or the Prince may appoint them, in the interests of curtailing a Sheriff’s overt power. While the job description may vary from city to city, the sheriffs prime job is to be the prince’s “enforcer,” the vampire who hauls offenders into court, keeps order on the streets, and generally stands ready to assist with the “muscle” aspects of ruling.</p>
<p>By invoking the authority of the Prince, the Sheriff may, in some domains where stability is more important than the rights of individual Kindred, violate the Traditions themselves. The Sheriff may employ these benefits only so long as the Prince grants her license, but it is sufficiently broad to make for a very versatile trump card, especially when dealing with those who threaten the Kindred order in a domain. Needless to say, those Sheriffs who breach the Traditions out of their own political expediency rather than in the Prince’s interests may soon find themselves stripped of their titles and starved of blood.</p>
<p><strong><u>Hound</u></strong></p>
<p>Hounds, who serve as the Sheriff's investigators and enforcers. Hounds may be keen-eyed, quick-witted factfinders, but just as frequently, they’re sadistic bullies who take pleasure in their sanctioned brand of corrupt justice. During an investigation or interrogation, a Hound may breach the Traditions if it becomes necessary to bring a rogue Kindred to heel. Princes generally grant Hounds a good deal of leeway in this regard, but repeated or egregious breaches, or violations that compound the crimes of a transgressor may well earn the Hound a censure or worse.</p>
<p><strong><u>The</u> <u>Keeper</u> <u>of</u> <u>Elysium</u>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This is a largely honorific title, though it has many practical responsibilities. The Keeper of Elysium assures that the customs of Elysium are observed, and is a caretaker of sites declared Elysium by a Prince.</p>
<p>The duties and privileges of the Keeper of Elysium begin and end in those hallowed halls. Once outside an area with Elysium status, the Keeper is just another Kindred. In fact, some large domains, or in domains where the Prince decentralizes the power of other Kindred of the court, each Elysium has its own separate Keeper. The ultimate result is the same: The Keeper of Elysium is both host and security in that august place, and she alone has the ability to remove transgressors against civility and personal safety.</p>
