<h1>A guide to the San Francisco Free City</h1>
<p>The Free City of San Francisco Free City (also known as San Francisco Free City, San Francisco, SFFC, or even just “The City”) is an unusual geopolitical area. Whole books have been written about its history; doctoral dissertations have covered its political peculiarities, and multiple guidebooks are available describing the sights and experiences available for visitors and residents alike. Here, however, we will attempt to provide an overview of the unique area known as the San Francisco Free City.</p>

<h2><strong>History:</strong></h2>
<p>In the mid-1800s, California was the site of numerous military conflicts between three major powers: the United States of America, the Mexican Republic, and the British Empire. Crucially, when gold was discovered in the area between the port town of Victoria (present-day San Francisco) and Fort Sutter (present-day Sacramento), the United Kingdom was in control of Victoria and therefore a large share of the newly mined gold. Intending to maintain a permanent hold on the west coast of North America, Queen Victoria allowed much of the new wealth to remain in Victoria, investing in infrastructure and helping the burgeoning town to grow larger. However, unknown to the English queen, General John Fremont, long-since believed dead, was secretly gathering US Army troops in preparation to retake Victoria and deny the UK its only port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All General Fremont’s plans would have remained unrealized, if it hadn’t been for a miscalculation made by the ruling British governor, Sir Henry Fox and his chief of staff, Lord Strange. Governor Fox had previously approved the use of privateers; that is, pirate vessels officially given leave to prey on merchant vessels belonging to the United States. One of the ships, known as the Black Harlequin, was captained by the dread pirate Christian Archer. Captain Archer and Lord Strange became emmeshed in a dispute, the nature of which has been lost to history. This disagreement caused Governor Fox to revoke the privateer authorization for the Black Harlequin, and Lord Strange personally issued a warrant for the arrest of Captain Archer. The erstwhile and again pirate captain, however, had been secretly amassing a fleet of ships, and when word came of the revocation and warrant, Captain Archer put this fleet at the service of General Fremont.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The British Navy, knowing that there were few US Naval ships in the vicinity and having control of the English Canal (present-day Panama Canal), had nearly all their ships at anchor in the Bay. Under cover of darkness, one moonless night, the Black Harlequin and her sister ships silently slipped in between the sleeping warships, and in one coordinated strike, effectively eliminated the entire British naval detachment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the British troops were watching in horror as their navy sunk to the depths, General Fremont attacked, and the demoralized defenders fought as best the could against a foe that used its tactical advantage to make up for their smaller numbers. The US troops also took advantage of the poor lighting conditions to ambush their English counterparts. And, in an especially ironic turn of events, the Port Authority, which had sworn service to Queen Victoria, renounced their oath to the Crown and turned on the British. Although the Port Authority was barely a full platoon, they were devastatingly effective, and the British commanders cursed this sudden but (some might say) inevitable betrayal. However, the British troops were well-trained and equipped, and when dawn broke, the battle was still in progress, and the British began pushing the US soldiers back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The battle waged for days, although it had an odd ebb and flow. During the bright of day, the British seemed to hold the upper hand; at night, it was the US troops that dominated the field, with General Fremont personally leading his armies from the front lines, heedless of the danger to his life. One can only guess which army would have eventually claimed victory, however, as the week neared its end, another player was to reenter the field of war: Mexico. Ships disgorged a host of troops to the west of both the US and UK forces, which found themselves needing to fall back into the city proper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would Victoria have been destroyed under the feet of these might armies? Fortunately, the citizens were spared this, as something miraculous happened. The three military commanders (or their designees): General John Fremont for the US; Lieutenant-General Leslie Montgomery representing the United Kingdom; and General José María Flores of Mexico; came together to discuss terms. A fourth person whose name has been lost to history mediated the negotiations, and the Treaty of the Golden Gates was drafted in that single night (fun fact: the Golden Gate Bridge is named after this treaty!). This treaty is what created the foundation for San Francisco, but there was still one other influential event that happened before it was signed.</p>
<p>Prior to the outbreak of the California War, Victoria had endured a series of arsons linked to a criminal organization known as the Red Hand Gang. Several prominent—and a few infamous—businesses were damaged or even destroyed by fire, including the oldest brothel in the city, MBMZ (formerly the Salon and before that, the Mariposa). The recently upgraded natural gas lighting and heating system installed through much of downtown Victoria, did not help matters. A citizen protection group calling itself the Eyes aided in the efforts to apprehend the criminals and achieved some success. When war broke out, the gang fortuitously ceased its attacks, and when the combatants also ceased fighting the residents of Victoria breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>They had relaxed too soon. The next morning, as the draft of the Treaty was being prepared for the historic signing, something happened that no one had expected—the Inquisition. This religious order (the predecessor to the modern Church) had ferreted out heretical teachings—even demon worship—and using fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, and an almost fanatical devotion to the Pope, the Inquisition struck hard using steel and fire. Several other historical structures, including the Oddfellows Building (which was later repaired and again restored following the 1906 earthquake and fire) and La Galerie Nuit, were severely damaged. Just after noon, Cardinal Pectore, head of the Order of the Cruciform Sword (essentially the same as the modern order that still protects humanity today), convened a meeting with the military leaders (note that historians disagree as to General Fremont’s presence—Church historians have recorded that Fremont was represented instead by Captain John McElroy, the Army Chaplain). Cardinal Pectore argued that the entire area should be ceded to the control of the Church.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This created a problem, as the original agreement saw the division of the city between the original three belligerents. It seemed as if the talks would break down and that hostilities might recommence at nightfall. But General María Flores realized that there might be an opportunity here to create a lasting legacy. He proposed that each country would keep the territory they currently held without dispute; for the UK, that meant all of Canada (and eventually the Alaskan Territory which was purchased by the UK from Russia). For the United States, they held all the modern 48 states, although they gave up their claims to the territory south of present-day Los Angeles / Angelorum. Mexico would retain the gains they had made into California, but otherwise cede the rest of the newest state to the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But María Flores wasn’t finished. He proposed that the area that had been the locus of this dispute be turned into a sovereign state, where the three countries would retain separate enclaves. Cardinal Pectore (and, if the Church histories are accurate, Captain McElroy) proposed that the Church would also maintain and enclave here, to better guide men’s souls to God.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The separate sides conferred and agreed. Not wanting to risk another unexpected obstacle, the representatives signed on behalf of their governments, and the Treaty of the Golden Gates became real as the sun set on the new sovereign state. Common tellings say that General Fremont was angry that his subordinate had given more territory away, but the agreement was signed and the possibility of losing more than he had acquired apparently dissuaded him from challenging it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, the new city-state took shape. The land in an area seven miles by seven miles square would be known as the Free City of San Francisco (two nearby islands, Pelican Island and Goat Island, were also gifted to the new polity as part of the treaty). This independent sovereign city would eventually grow into the cultural, financial, and political powerhouse that it is today. All the land in this area was officially part of San Francisco, but four enclaves were created within the territory. England would hold much of the developed downtown area of Victoria, keeping the same name for the City. The western side, most of it pristine forest, plains, and dunes, went to the United States and was called “Fremont,” in honor of General John Fremont. The south and southeastern part of the city, which already had more than a few Mexican farms, would officially be given to Mexico and known as “Buena Vista.”. The Church would hold an area near the center of the city. San Francisco would control travel into and out of the city-state, as well as travel between the enclaves, but each enclave would be semi-autonomous with regard to their internal concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This arrangement would prove to be remarkably stable. During the US civil war, which began shortly after the events of the Treaty of the Golden Gates, San Francisco served as a neutral territory and intermediary for both domestic (with reference to the US) and foreign powers. Tensions rose a few times; notably during the governmental upheavals in Mexico, the Great Earthquake, and the first World War. SFFC increased its control and authority over its territory in response, and the walls between the enclaves were built in the decade before the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge. The San Francisco Defense Force was instrumental in keeping the west coast of North America (and the interests of Mexico, the UK, and the US) safe from the events of the second World War. Agreements between the North American city-state and the empire of Japan, signed on the Japanese colony of Hawaii, kept the war between the out of the Pacific other than a few minor clashes between British and Japanese ships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More recently, the City has been host to several world leaders, including Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom and ruler of the British Empire; Louis Ferdinand, German Emperor and King of Prussia; Louis XX, King of France and ruler of the Franco-Spanish Empire, and Shouwa, Emperor of Japan and ruler of the Sino-Japanese Empire.&nbsp;</p>
