<h1>Government of San Francisco Free City</h1>
<p>San Francisco has an unusual system of government. There are 11 council members (called Councilors) representing specific political spheres: Corporate, Defense, Education, Finance, Housing, Infrastructure, Labor, Legal, Media, Science, State. Each sphere has its own method of selecting its representative, but that representative then holds nearly exclusive and absolute authority over the operations of its sphere except where one or more other spheres are impacted. In the event of minor disagreements between councilors, a third-party councilor is typically asked to resolve the dispute; in more complicated (or disruptive) disagreements, the remaining council members will create a binding joint resolution. In addition to the councilors, each sphere has a bureaucratic head (called a Secretary) who is prohibited from serving as a councilor except on an acting or interim basis. The day-to-day operations of the government itself are run by an Administrator who is appointed by a majority vote from the City Council; while serving in this capacity, the Administrator is answerable only to the City Council.</p>
<p>The City Council is the ultimate legislative, executive, and judicial body in the Free City. There are a very few legal controls on its authority:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A councilor can be involuntarily removed by a consensus vote of the other councilors.</li>
  <li>A councilor can be removed by their sphere by methods that vary by sphere.</li>
  <li>The citizens of San Francisco (only the Free City, not citizens of other enclaves) can declare a referendum to override a decision made by the council or remove a councilor by a 2/3rds majority of voting citizens.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Law Enforcement</strong></h2>
<p>San Francisco’s law enforcement officials are called “Peacekeepers,” and are the primary face of the criminal justice system. They respond to allegations of criminal activity, conduct the investigation, determine the necessary response, and implement it. For citizens, this usually ranges from a warning (for citizens in good standing) to a fine. More extreme offenses or those committed by citizens in less-than-good standing can result in revocation of citizenship, forfeiture of property and assets, and permanent expulsion from the Free City. Note here that Persona Non Grata (PNG) status also means that the subject cannot take up residence in any other enclave in San Francisco. For visitors to San Francisco, violations nearly always result in at least a fine, although expulsion (temporary or permanent) is also quite frequent. Note here that a visitor who has been only temporarily expelled *may* opt to go instead to an enclave as long as they don’t attempt to exit the enclave until the expulsion period has passed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citizens who have received an assessment of any type from a Peacekeeper may appeal the decision to the Appellate (within the Legal sphere). They may appeal revocation of their citizenship within their assigned sphere or to the Council (although the Council may decline to hear the case). Visitors have no right to appeal, unless a citizen chooses to appeal on their behalf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no prisons within the Free City, although there are temporary holding facilities for those in the midst of the legal process (such as prior to their expulsion from the City). The crime rate in San Francisco is extremely low and violent crimes are particularly rare. Weapons are not allowed outside of enclaves, and the Peacekeepers have unfettered authority to search anyone they suspect may be armed. They likewise are authorized to use whatever force they deem necessary to enforce the law and preserve public order. However, corruption and overt abuse of authority among Peacekeepers is rare, as intentional violation of their duties carries a penalty of permanent expulsion.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Entry, visiting, residency, and citizenship</strong></h2>
<p>Entry into San Francisco for any purpose, including transit only or to visit an enclave, occurs only at designated entry points. There are three land entry points (Golden Gate Bridge, the Bay Bridge, Peninsula Gate), one airport (Crissy Field) and five water ports (one in the Presidio [for military and diplomatic vessels only], one main port for the Free City, and one in each enclave [but managed by the Free City]). People wishing to enter San Francisco are stopped, questioned, and subject to search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visitors to SFFC that wish to experience more than a short visit to the City proper must arrange for residency (even short term) ahead of their entry; however, this can be done on arrival at the entry checkpoint. Those who will be staying in an enclave and who have made arrangements with that enclave prior to or on arrival may generally come and go through the City itself as they wish; however, they are prohibited from staying more than 12 hours and must remain outside the City or within an enclave for a period of not less than 12 hours before reentering the City.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Persons desiring to become citizens of San Francisco must be sponsored by one of the council spheres. This is typically done by filling an application with the Secretary’s office. While technically not necessary, it is helpful to have a reference from at least one member of that sphere. Once one is provisionally accepted as a citizen, there is a one year probationary period during which any violation of City rules or loss of sponsorship results in termination of the citizenship process. After the probationary period, one is deemed a “citizen in good standing” and obtains all the rights and privileges of citizenship.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible to become a resident of San Francisco without being a citizen in certain circumstances; primarily through marriage.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Rights, privileges, and good standing</strong></h2>
<p>Citizens are subject to the rules and regulations of their assigned sphere (note that children are fully the responsibility of their parents or the Education sphere, as appropriate). As such, there are no specifically enumerated “rights” such as those provided in the US Constitution. Every citizen in good standing may freely speak, assemble, and associate, subject only to the requirements of their sphere. Citizens who violate the rules of their sphere are not in good standing, and are subject to the penalties and punishments deemed appropriate by their sphere. The general rule followed by all the spheres is that citizens can take any action that does not have a directly detrimental and substantial effect on any other person without that other person’s knowledge and consent, unless the action is mandated by the requirements of the first person’s sphere (for example, Peacekeepers in the performance of their duties).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visitors to the San Francisco Free City are reminded that, except within an enclave, they are guests only and should behave as such. They hold no specific rights beyond that of personal necessity.&nbsp;</p>
