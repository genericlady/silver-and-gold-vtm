<p>Castle Ferenczy does not at all look like a structure one would find in the United States. It strongly resembles a fortress from eastern Europe, except for being made of brick and not cut stone. The windows have heavy wooden shutters, reinforced with iron. Many of them are closed tightly, but a very few show flickering lights. Most of the chimneys have curls of smoke rising from them. The castle itself is on the edge of a steep cliff, and it is at least 300' down to the crashing ocean waves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A set of stone steps lead to the huge front doors. The wood looks thicker than the hull of a battleship, and they are bound with thick iron bands. There is a long rope hanging down near the door.</p>
