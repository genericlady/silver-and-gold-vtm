<p>Fort Wrency is an abandoned fort on the San Francisco coast in Buena Vista (the Mexican quarter), nearly at the very borders of the City and far from habitation. There are no existing records of who constructed it or when it was built, but it may have been used by one of the three warring governments prior to the Treaty of the Golden Gates. Locals tend to avoid it as it has a reputation for being haunted, and rumor has it that at night, one can see the flickering of lights, as if a candle were being carried past a window. This is, however, unlikely, as a daytime visit shows that the windows all have heavy wooden shutters, reinforced with iron. Despite Fort Wrency's age and status, it appears to be completely secure.</p>
