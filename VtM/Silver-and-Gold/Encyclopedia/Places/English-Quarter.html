<p>Victoria is one of the four semi-autonomous quarters within the San Francisco Free City. As such, it serves as an extraterritorial extension of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Victoria is one of the oldest parts of the Free City. It has a population of about 300,000 people. The Governor of Victoria oversees this enclave, a position currently held by Sir (John) William Napier Bunbury, 12th Baronet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Victoria is one of the more densely populated areas of San Francisco. It's roots in Victorian times are still very apparent, as the streets and residents look as if they would be entirely comfortable in a Dickensian novel. The main streets are busy and have respectable businesses, but the labyrinthine side alleys are less so. Victoria is also a financial powerhouse, and much of the wealth of the gold rush was reinvested here. All the major world banks (and many minor ones) have branches or even their headquarters here, as do a number of international well-known law firms.</p>
<p>Victoria's police officers generally do not carry firearms, but they are quick to give a thump with their truncheons or the toe of their boot to “miscreants” and “acting the fool” will definitely result in immediate corporal punishment.&nbsp;</p>
