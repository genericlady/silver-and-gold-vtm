<p>The Medical Examiner's Office and Morgue provide several services. First and foremost, they conduct autopsies / make the official cause of death findings. Second, they serve as a holding station for bodies before funeral services. Third, they prepare bodies for whatever type of funerary service they are to receive, whether the burial is to take place in the Church District or if the body will be shipped outside of San Francisco. Finally, although they are no longer in use, there are a series of catacombs underneath the buildings; however, the entrance has been long since sealed up.</p>
<p>The building is a rambling structure. The main public entrance leads to a reception area, where visitors who are there for official business (for example, identifying a body) are separated from grieving loved ones. This is the most modern wing of the building. Behind this are the offices, and then they are three separate wings with autopsy rooms, laboratories, and such. Finally, in the oldest building, which dates back to the 1800s, is the cold storage area for bodies. The medical wings are named after the main donors / benefactors to the building, the Shelley Wing, the Blaylock Wing, and the Ellis Wing.</p>
<p>Dr. Boyd Stephens previously owned this practice and still works here. Dr. Shelley is the current owner of record and signs many of the death certificates. In actuality, Dr. Shelley is an alias of Viktor's.&nbsp;</p>
