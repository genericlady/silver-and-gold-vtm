<p>The Medical Examiner's Office and Morgue, located in the Free City, provide several services. First and foremost, they conduct autopsies / make the official cause of death findings. Second, they serve as a holding station for bodies before funeral services. Third, they prepare bodies for whatever type of funerary service they are to receive, whether the burial is to take place in the Church District or if the body will be shipped outside of San Francisco. Finally, although they are no longer in use, there are a series of catacombs underneath the buildings; however, the entrance has been long since sealed up.</p>
<p>The building is a rambling structure. The main public entrance leads to a reception area, where visitors who are there for official business (for example, identifying a body) are separated from grieving loved ones. This is the most modern wing of the building. Behind this are the offices, and then they are three separate wings with autopsy rooms, laboratories, and such. Finally, in the oldest building, which dates back to the 1800s, is the cold storage area for bodies. The medical wings are named after the main donors / benefactors to the building, the Shelley Wing, the Blaylock Wing, and the Ellis Wing. The morgue / cold storage area is just called the Old Wing. The Medical Examiner's office, by itself, can handle a maximum of 36 autopsies / day and can store a total 360 bodies. The hospitals / emergency centers in the Free City and quarters add an additional capacity for 10 autopsies / day and storage for another 70 corpses. As the death rate from all causes averages 30 deaths per day, there currently exists sufficient capacity to handle the expected number of deaths requiring autopsy (approximately 30% of all deaths).</p>
<p>Dr. Boyd Stephens, the great-great grandson of the original founder of this practice, is the current Chief Medical Examiner.</p>
