<p>The Bella Viva Inn is located in San Ysidro and run by John Gilroy. The Ketchem Heavy Freight and Passenger Company has a contract with the Inn, which has quarters specifically for "VIPs." There is an attached "barn" that is used as a stagecoach post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After passing from the garage-like barn into the bar area, one heads up the wooden staircase, passing a number of closed doors with room numbers on them. At the end of the hall is a single, unmarked door with a keyhole but no obvious handle. Through the door is a small closet of a room with two notable features; a single candle, half-burned down in its holder, and an iron-wrought spiral staircase descending down into what must be the cellar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Descending the staircase, one finds another lone candle here. The cellar is as quiet as a tomb, and the air is chill and sharp. Instead of a large open space, the basement is divided up in a way reminiscent of a monastery's cells, but the rooms are apparently made of brick and the doors and door frames of iron. There are letters on the doors. When unlocked, the doors open to small spaces, about 6' wide, 10' high, and 8' long. They are sparsely furnished, with nothing more than a cot and a small chest of drawers with a wash basin full of water atop it. There are a set of linens sitting next to the basin. Each room also has a small oil lantern and a tube of matchsticks. A chamber pot is under the bed. The last thing you notice is that the door can be securely bolted from the inside.</p>
