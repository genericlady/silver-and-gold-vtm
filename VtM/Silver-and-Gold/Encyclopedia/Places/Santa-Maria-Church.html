<p>The Church of Santa Maria used to be the largest church in San Francisco. Now, that honor is held by St. Francis' Cathedral; however, Santa Maria still holds a special place in the hearts and minds of the religious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two ancient cemeteries here, with an associated series of crypts and labyrinths. One of the cemeteries is considerably older than the other, and history holds that it predates the earliest colonial settlements.</p>
