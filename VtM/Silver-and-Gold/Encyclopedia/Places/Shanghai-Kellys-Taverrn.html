<p>Shanghai Kelly's is a bar and inn with a storied history. It was established during the first US attempt to occupy San Francisco (called Yerba Buena) and continuing to function during the English occupation and creation of Victoria. James Kelly, the founder, catered to the sailors who were in port and especially those who didn't want to (or couldn't) sleep aboard their ships. However, Kelly had a secret; he was drugging some of the sailors and selling them to desperate captains looking for crew. There are rumors of other and even more nefarious acts that the bar owner engaged in, but none of these allegations were ever proven, and James Kelly was found brutally murdered late one night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the bar remains a popular spot with travelers and, despite its history, dockworkers and sailors.&nbsp;</p>
