<p>It is 1849. Victoria is a small port town located on the West Coast of North America, in the disputed territory of California. With a population of around 50,000, Victoria has been steadily growing. While it is claimed by the governments of Mexico and California, it is currently occupied by the British Empire. In addition to the port for ships, there is a facility for receiving passenger and freight stage coaches, a church, a cemetery for the faithful and one for those denied the grace of God, a few taverns / saloons / inns, one brothel, a general store, and a sheriff's office. There are also numerous other establishments.</p>
<p>Recently, the Camarilla has decreed Victoria to be a new outpost, and each clan has assigned a representative to this port town.</p>
<p>Victoria has four main districts; the Waterfront, which is by far the busiest area; Downtown, which is adjacent to the Waterfront; the South of Main area (SOMA), where stables and a few farms are located; and the Outerlands, where there are some homes and a few old stone structures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Government Structure:</p>
<p>Crown Colony Governor - Lord Governor Sir Henry Fox</p>
<p>Mayor - At present time, Victoria has no elected leadership. Lord Strange, Chief of Staff to Governor Fox, has been acting in this capacity. His loyal assistant, Carrot, is the deputy mayor.</p>
<p>City council - Currently suspended. Formerly consisted of Captain Oster from the Portmaster's office, Francisco Pedraza, representing Governor Pico, Old Man Vayard from the Freight and Passenger Depot, Father Serra from the Church, and Aaron Min, representing the merchants and traders.</p>
<p>Law Enforcement - Currently provided by British military patrols. Former Sheriff Bart Little (Black Bart) was murdered under mysterious circumstances.</p>
<p>Coroner - Doctor Thomas Stephens is one of the town doctors, but has a special interest in forensic pathology. He examines any corpse where the cause of death is in question. He has a long-term and quite vocal feud with Father Serra.</p>
<p>Also notable:</p>
<p>US Military Governor - General John Fremont. General Fremont is the US-appointed governor for the territory of California. He is nominally based in Sutter's Fort, near Sutter's Mill (near Sacramento in our world), however, he does visit other forts throughout the territory.</p>
<p>Mexican Governor - Governor Pio Pico. Based in Angelorum (Los Angeles in our world), Governor Pico is the appointed governor for all of California. He has strong ties with the Church and tends to use emissaries rather than engage in personal visits.&nbsp;</p>
