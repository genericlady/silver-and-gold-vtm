<p>The original Wonderful Things was located downtown near the borders of both SOMA and the Outerlands in old Victoria, however, it was destroyed in the Great Earthquake and Fire of 1906. The new store is located in Victoria. They stock a strange assortment of curiosities, many of them apparently from foreign lands.&nbsp;</p>
