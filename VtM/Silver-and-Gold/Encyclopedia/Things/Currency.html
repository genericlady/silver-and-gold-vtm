<p>One of the considerations in the Treaty of the Golden Gates was a determination of what the official currency of San Francisco would be. At the time, the Gold Rush meant that Victoria was already a banking powerhouse, and the UK insisted on the British pound. Since most of California outside of the Free City would belong to the United States, the US demanded that the American dollar be the official currency of the Free City. Mexico, having the oldest claim of the three nations on the territory, countered that it only made sense to use the Peso.</p>
<p>However, like many of the other seemingly irreducible impasses, a compromise would be reached. The currencies of any of the three nations would be accepted by all of them. Each nation would then exchange foreign currencies for their own with the Free City Central Bank. The SFFCCB would charge a small fee for the exchange, providing San Francisco with a small but stable income from its permanent guests. This coupled with the transfer of all the gold that was within the geographic borders gave the new city-state a financial core. The Treaty also contained a provision that San Francisco would be allowed first right to purchase any gold in California that was to be shipped from its ports. The UK agreed, knowing that the young (and at the time, poor) San Francisco would not be able to afford more than a fraction of the gold. However, a wealthy French citizen bequeathed a large sum of money to the Free City government with a few preconditions, the primary one being that it would be used to strictly to buy the English gold. Thus, to this day, San Francisco has one of the largest holdings of gold in the world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In modern times, the exchange rate of dollars, pesos, and pounds is relatively equivalent; however, the purchasing power of those things differs throughout the Free City and the enclaves. Of the Enclaves, goods and services in Victoria are generally more expensive and less so in &nbsp;Buena Vista, but there are exceptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Resources - Please note that “Savings” refers to liquid (or fairly liquid) assets; at any level you might effectively possess / control expensive non-liquid assets (NLAs). For example, someone with no ranks in resources might have the Crown of Thorns, which would effectively net at least six ranks worth of resources. However, you would first have to find a buyer, have to verify authenticity, etc.&nbsp;</p>
