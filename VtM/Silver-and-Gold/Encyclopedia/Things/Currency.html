<p>Most places in North America accept one or more of the following currencies: coins, US dollars, or Mexican Pesos.</p>
<p>Coins are minted from precious metals (primarily gold and silver) and are accepted almost everywhere. Gold coins are worth $5, and silver are worth $1 (with 50-cent pieces and quarters existing, as well as copper pennies). &nbsp;The biggest disadvantages to coins is their weight; they also make distinctive noises in one's purse, potentially identifying you as a target for thieves and pickpockets.</p>
<p>US dollars and Mexican Pesos are roughly equivalent; however, there exist some establishments that will only accept one or the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some merchants will also issue and accept letters of credit. As there are no banks in Yerba Buena at this time, the issuance and acceptance of these is entirely at the whim of the merchant in question.</p>
<p>For a quick rule of thumb, most items and fees are 100 times lower than in modern day. For example, a horse today would cost around $4000. In Yerba Buena, that same horse would cost around $40. A room at a boarding house costs about $1, depending on amenities and privacy.</p>
<p>This adjustment <strong>does </strong>apply to your Resources background trait (if you have it).&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you have one rank in Resources, you have a total savings of about $10 and receive income of about $2 / day.</li>
  <li>If you have two ranks in Resources, you have a total savings of about $80 and receive income of about $5 / day.</li>
  <li>If you have three ranks in Resources, you have a total savings of about $500 and receive income of about $15 / day.</li>
  <li>If you have four ranks in Resources, you have a total savings of about $5,000, and receive income of about $65 / day.</li>
  <li>If you have five ranks in Resources, you have a total savings of about $50,000, and receive income of about $300 / day.</li>
</ol>
