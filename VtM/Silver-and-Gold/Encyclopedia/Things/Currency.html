<p>One of the considerations in the Treaty of the Golden Gates was a determination of what the official currency of San Francisco would be. At the time, the Gold Rush meant that Victoria was already a banking powerhouse, and the UK insisted on the British pound. Since most of California outside of the Free City would belong to the United States, the US demanded that the American dollar be the official currency of the Free City. Mexico, having the oldest claim of the three nations on the territory, countered that it only made sense to use the Peso.</p>
<p>However, like many of the other seemingly irreducible impasses, a compromise would be reached. The currencies of any of the three nations would be accepted by all of them. Each nation would then exchange foreign currencies for their own with the Free City Central Bank. The SFFCCB would charge a small fee for the exchange, providing San Francisco with a small but stable income from its permanent guests. This coupled with the transfer of all the gold that was within the geographic borders gave the new city-state a financial core. The Treaty also contained a provision that San Francisco would be allowed first right to purchase any gold in California that was to be shipped from its ports. The UK agreed, knowing that the young (and at the time, poor) San Francisco would not be able to afford a fraction of the gold. However, a wealthy French citizen bequeathed a large sum of money to the Free City government with a few preconditions, the primary one being that it would be used to strictly to buy the English gold. Thus, to this day, San Francisco has one of the largest holdings of gold in the world. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To this day, the exchange rate of dollars, pesos, and pounds, is relatively equivalent; however, the purchasing power of those things differs throughout the Free City and the enclaves.</p>

<p>This adjustment <strong>does </strong>apply to your Resources background trait (if you have it).&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you have one rank in Resources, you have a total savings of about $10 and receive income of about $2 / day.</li>
  <li>If you have two ranks in Resources, you have a total savings of about $80 and receive income of about $5 / day.</li>
  <li>If you have three ranks in Resources, you have a total savings of about $500 and receive income of about $15 / day.</li>
  <li>If you have four ranks in Resources, you have a total savings of about $5,000, and receive income of about $65 / day.</li>
  <li>If you have five ranks in Resources, you have a total savings of about $50,000, and receive income of about $300 / day.</li>
</ol>
