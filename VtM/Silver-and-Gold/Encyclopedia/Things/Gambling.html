<p>Casinos are illegal in Fremont (although there are certainly underground ones). Gambling in general is illegal. The one exception to this is poker, which <strong>is </strong>legal even in public establishments (like nightclubs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Casinos are legal in Victoria with the caveat that they are private (members-only) clubs. As with Fremont, underground clubs exist. Gambling is illegal outside of licensed casinos.</p>
<p>Gambling is technically legal in Buena Vista, but they aren't played for money; rather favors and such.</p>
<p>Gambling is legal in Free City as are casinos, and regulated by the Finance or Media council, depending on whether it is intended primarily as revenue for the government or as entertainment for the residents.</p>
<p>Gambling is illegal in the Church District. Rumor has it that, if you go to the Sinners' Graveyard at Old St. Mary's Chruch, you can wager your immortal soul to the devil in return for fame / wealth / power, but that's a different kind of gamble. ðŸ˜ˆ</p>
