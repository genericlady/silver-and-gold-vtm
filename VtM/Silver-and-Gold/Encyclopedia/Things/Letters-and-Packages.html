<p>Currently, in 1848, sending a message or a package is done by a few different means.</p>
<p>Local destination (same town) - Letters and packages are delivered by townsfolk, there not being any mail service. The cheapest method is to pay one of the town children to take the item to its intended destination. Enterprising youths learn very early that speedy and reliable deliveries are generally rewarded with repeat business. Prices vary from one cent (a letter, delivered as the youth makes their rounds) to 10 cents (a small package or a letter delivered directly) to a quarter (special instructions to be followed). Large packages, especially ones that are heavy or bulky may cost up to $1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local destination (within 20-25 miles) - Letters and packages are generally delivered by townsfolk, although it is also possible to contract with one of the representatives operating out of the <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Yerba-Buena/places/Overland-Freight">Overland Freight and Passenger Depot</a>. Older teens usually handle this service, as even without a horse they can walk the roundtrip before nightfall. If the message or small package is sent in the early morning (thus allowing the teenager to avoid having to camp or find lodging overnight), then the cost is $1 for a letter or small package. However, if the recipient of the delivery wants to send something back, as long as the return trip begins with an hour of arrival, there is no charge. If the letter or package is sent after 9am, or the package is larger than can be comfortably carried the distance, then the delivery is made on horse back, and the price is $2. If the package is heavy or bulky, one most negotiate with one of the freight services operating out of the depot; the price can vary wildly. Deliveries are almost always done the same day.</p>
<p>Within the California territory - Letters and packages are usually delivered by a Freight Service or ship or combination of the two. Deliveries are usually completed within two to ten days, depending on the distance. The price varies with the destination; if it is on a heavily travelled route, the cost is lower. A letter may cost between $1-$3. Package delivery starts at $5 and climbs depending on the size, weight, and distance.</p>
<p>Within North America - Letters to and from Yerba Buena either follow the overland route or are carried aboard ship. The overland route is much faster--a letter sent from Yerba Buena to New York can arrive in 14-20 days; however, weather and attacks on the riders can result in the letter being lost and never arriving. Sending letters by ship is much safer as ships are infrequently lost to sea, but it takes approximately one and a half months from port to port, and once the ship arrives the letter still needs to be delivered to the final recipient (although the cost of this extra delivery step is included in the price charged by the ship's service). There are companies on the East Coast that are testing a “telegraph” service that will cut overland delivery time further and ensure more reliable delivery. Sending a letter costs $5 regardless of the route taken, as each service believes it's benefit (speed or security) to be worth the equivalent cost.</p>
<p>Packages almost always go aboard ship, as the weight matters less on the ocean and chance of interception by bandits is much lower, although pirate ships do still operate in this time. Packages can be sent overland via contract with one of the overland freight companies. Packages sent by ship vary in price but cost around 10 cents per pound with a $5 minimum; overland packages cost $1 per pound, also with a $5 minimum and with a premium charged for packages that are especially bulky or over 50 lbs in weight.</p>
<p>In all instances, it is possible to pay more for extra services.</p>
<p>Special note: certain organizations, notably the Church, the US government, the Mexican government, and the Portmaster, have additional communications methods. The Church sends missionaries from Mission to Mission throughout California carrying news and messages (and occasionally packages). The US and Mexican governments sometimes use military couriers to bring messages directly to their offices at the Portmaster. The Portmaster receives communiques from ships, passed on via semaphore from Pelican Island and the ships themselves, as well as direct military dispatches. However, it should be noted that other than the Church and the Portmaster, all but the most urgent and / or confidential of messages stop first at the Overland Freight and Passenger Depot.</p>
