<p>Being a monster - “Monsters you are, lest monsters you become”</p>
<p><s>Haven Background - Keeping this simple; each dot is a separate Haven you've obtained.</s></p>
<p><s>Experience Points for New Experiences - Obsolete.</s></p>
<p>Spending XP points - <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Experience-points">/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Experience-points</a></p>
<p><s>Collaborating outside of the game LETTERS!!!!!! - One easy way to collaborate on your agendas is to write letters to each other using email.</s></p>
<p>Guns and other weapons - <s>Guns are not as prevalent in Old West towns as one might have assumed. You can carry a gun, but they are not ubiquitous.&nbsp;</s> The laws regarding weapons differ depending on where in San Francisco you are. <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Encyclopedia/Things/Firearms-and-other-weapons">/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Encyclopedia/Things/Firearms-and-other-weapons</a></p>
<p>Front stage and player vs character info - Regardless of whether your character is present in a scene, you must keep Player Knowledge and Character Knowledge separate.</p>
<p>Initiative dice roller - Roll 1d10 and add (Dex+Wits+Celerity) to the die, and then subtract any wound penalties</p>
<p>Secondary Ability - These are cheaper to acquire than primary abilities, and difficulties are 1 less if you have an appropriate secondary ability. <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Admin-Stuff">/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Admin-Stuff</a></p>
<p>Setting scenes: who's there, why, and where? - In the shot list, I will generally indicate who will be there, where the scene is, and why they are there. You may request to be added to a scene.</p>

<p>Disciplines - <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Disciplines">/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Disciplines</a></p>
<p><s>Interludes before scenes - Obsolete</s></p>
<p>Humans and animals and the "background", "extras" and recurring regulars - Just because I don't mention that there are Kine or animals in a scene doesn't mean they are absent from that scene or the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>Waking up (Changed time). Sun sets at 7pm (dusk until 7:30) and rises at 6am (dawn at 5:30). Humanity/Path rating 8 or higher rises at 7, 5-7 at 7:30, and 4 or lower at 8.</p>
<p>Seeing in the dark (Fighting -2 and no ranged, Auspex, Protean, other disciplines; moonlight, starlight, light from houses, gaslamps, etc)&nbsp;</p>
<p><s>Interludes replaced with requesting a scene (know your character's needs / unanticipated items)</s></p>
<p>Old ghouls out of blood (good until the end of the month)</p>
<p><s>XP - One point RP for session regardless of players. No points otherwise except at ST's discretion</s></p>
<p><s>Travel - Horses walk about 4 mph. A typical ride max is about 32 miles in a night. Horses at this speed aren't affected much by terrain, although climbing reduces the speed by 1/3 (2 and 16). Wagon travel is about 2 mph (twice that on roads), or about 16 miles in a night. Wagons can handle rough terrain and hills, although the speed is halved for either (and quartered for both). Carriages / Stagecoaches can travel 10 mph on smooth terrain (15 mph on actual roads) if the horses are changed out every 2 hours. Otherwise, they can travel at 5 mph for a night (40 miles) but then require a day of rest. On rough terrain or hilly terrain, speeds are halved, and the chance of a breakdown is high.&nbsp;</s></p>
<p>Walking speed for Kindred?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Walking is 7 yards per turn (just under 5 mph). The only limits on walking are practical ones (e.g., sunrise).</li>
  <li>Jogging is 12+(Dex+Celerity) yards per turn. You may jog for Stamina hours, after that, each hour requires a Willpower roll at Difficulty (10-Stamina) where failure means stopping and botching means injury. Rough terrain requires a Dex+Athletics roll (Difficulty 4-6) to keep from tripping.</li>
  <li>Running is 20+( 3x[Dex+Celerity]) yards per turn. You may run for Stamina turns, after that each turn requires a Willpower roll at Difficulty (10-Stamina) where failure means stopping and botching means injury. Rough terrain requires Dex+Athletics roll (Difficulty 6-8) to keep from falling. Additionally, terrain or circumstances may prohibit running.</li>
</ul>
<p><s>So why not just walk to Lands End? You can. However, horses are generally better at finding their way through broken and rough terrain (even in the dark), and can carry more gear comfortably.&nbsp;</s></p>
<p><s>Ferenczy fortress is a 2-day trip. Gilroy is the stopping point. Ketchem Heavy Freight and Passenger Service.</s></p>
<p><s>Options: At the beginning of the evening, you may OPT to pay for Blush of Life for the whole night, for 1 extra blood point above what you would normally pay, instead of per scene. The advantage is you avoid having to potentially pay multiple times. Obviously, the disadvantage is that you pay more AND there are no "refunds" if you don't have opportunity to use it. Because I am providing two options (pay up front or pay as you go), I plan on making social interactions more difficult when you don't use Blush of Life, and the possibility of detection (and violation of the Masquerade) will likely increase.</s></p>
<p>Willpower: <s>As far as I recall, only one player (Tan) has used Willpower at all during the game. As such, I am instituting the following rule; at the beginning of the evening, when you mark off your blood point for rising, you will *receive* one Willpower point. </s>As a reminder, Willpower can be used in the following ways:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • A single point can be spent in a turn on a single action to give the character one automatic (and guaranteed) success. There a very few actions that can't use Willpower in this way; in most cases, if you concentrate and really exert yourself (by spending a Willpower point), you can succeed. You must announce that you spending a Willpower point *before* you roll--you can't concentrate on a task after the fact! (Also as noted, rolling to prevent Humanity loss is one of the few times where you cannot use a Willpower point.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • If a character would take an instinctive action, like leaping away from sunlight suddenly pouring in through a previously dark window, you can usually spend a Willpower point to avoid taking this reflexive action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • If you have a Derangement, you can spend a Willpower point to avoid having it manifest in a scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Spending a Willpower point will allow you to ignore wound penalties for a single turn; unless you are incapacitated or in Torpor.</p>
<p>Passage of time and blood points: Sometimes, we will be jumping ahead narratively from a few days to a week or two, especially if there's been a lot of backstage activity without as much going on the front stage. When this happens, instead of deducting a point of blood for waking, you will roll 1d10+Herd (if you have it). That's your starting blood for the night. May the odds be ever in your favor! (Sometimes, you just have bad luck hunting.)</p>
<p>Blood bonds, feeding, contacts, etc. - <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Blood-Bonds">/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Blood-Bonds</a> <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Backgrounds">/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Backgrounds</a></p>
<p><s>The backstage notes - Added to Roll20</s></p>
<p><s>Backstage sessions - Everything we conduct between sessions.</s></p>
<p>Contacts and Reports: Dates (parenthetical vs in-game) - Dates that are in parenthesis are when I made the note, IRL. Dates that are not in parenthesis and that start with 1849 (or another in-game year) are the in-game date of the report / news / whatever.</p>
<p><s>Mark boons that you owe! Coordinate with Todd</s></p>
<p><s>New schedule will still include one Saturday daytime. Emails forthcoming, please pay attention!</s></p>
