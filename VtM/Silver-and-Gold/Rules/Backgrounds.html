<p>Backgrounds: These traits include anything from Allies and Contacts to Influence and Resources. One important note is that, after a character is first created, Backgrounds cannot be acquired through the expenditure of experience points. Characters acquire new background traits, enhance current ones, or lose existing ones through in-game events and roleplay. For example, if the Prince of the City wants influence over mortal institutions (the Influence trait), then the Prince will have to contrive a means in-game to get that influence. If a character with a lot of wealth (represented by high levels of the Resources trait) squanders their riches, or invests poorly, or is the victim of theft, those Resources can be lost.</p>
<p>Special notes on specific backgrounds:</p>
<p><strong>Allies, Contacts, Mentors, and Retainers </strong>(note: see also “Herd," below)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allies - These are people who willingly provide you aid and information. The character neither commands them nor needs to coerce them. They are friends, family, and the like. They will likely incur hardship and face significant risk in the character's defense, although they can't be expected to sacrifice themselves or the equivalent. Note that Allies expect that the relationship is reciprocal, and will expect the character will aid them in their hour of need as well. If the character is Batman, examples of Allies would be Superman, Nightwing, or Batgirl.</li>
  <li>Contacts - These are people the character knows, and may be able to provide aid or information, albeit usually at a price. Where Allies see the relationship as reciprocal, Contacts see each contact as transactional (this doesn't mean that a character can't have a friendly relationship with the Contact). Contacts are much less likely to put themselves out on the character's behalf, unless of course they are receiving something commensurate in return. Commissioner Gordon is a Contact of Batman.</li>
  <li>Mentors - Mentors can be similar to both Allies and Contacts, but the main difference is that they almost always have an agenda that guides their decisions, and the character's adherence to that agenda is the primary deciding factor as to whether they receive help from the mentor. Batman is Robins' (yes, I meant to put the apostrophe there) Mentor.</li>
  <li>Retainers - These characters, often ghouls, are most like employees of the characters, or are in some other way under the direct control, authority, and/or power of the character (for example, a blood bonded mortal, or someone under the influence of long-term Presence). They will generally do what the character asks of them, although the relationship is neither as transactional as that of a Contact nor are they (usually) willing to go as far in helping the character as an Ally. Alfred is Batman's retainer, but an exceptional one (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Are there any other differences between the categories? </i>Yes. Mentors tend to be more powerful than the character. Allies generally are within the same power range, although this doesn't account for differences like mortal vs vampire. Contacts tend to be less powerful overall than the character, although Contacts are almost always better than the character in their core area (Commissioner Gordon is better than the Batman at Police Procedures, for example). Retainers vary quite a bit in their power level but are usually balanced with the whatever it is that makes them a retainer; for example, you can pay any attorney to be your retainer, but if you want the most famous attorney ever to be at your beck and call, you will probably have to blood-bond them, which is likely to have detrimental effects on their career.</p>
<p><i>Can a character fit under more than one category?</i> Of course. To continue the Batman example, Alfred definitely would and did risk his life for Batman, even if Batman took him off the payroll. However, their primary relationship is that of an employer to a (very competent and much loved) employee, and therefore he would be listed as a Retainer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Can a character change categories? </i>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Fame and Influence</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fame - How well known the character is. This has both benefits and disadvantages. In the RAW, this applies generally to the mortal world; however, it seems to me that Fame should apply equally to both worlds to an extent, with the caveat that the longer the person has been famous, the more likely that even older Kindred would know them. Fame is the "Do you know who I am?" method of getting people to do things.</li>
  <li>Influence - This applies exclusively to the normal (Kine) world. Influence lets you manipulate actions within the mortal world. It can get a warrant for arrest issued (or quashed). It can get the plans for the new secret Haven through the cogs of bureaucracy or get it tied up in red tape. Influence is the "Officer, in a moment that phone is going to ring. You should take the call, tell the chief I say "hi," and then you'll want to take these handcuffs off me." Note this is similar to, but not the same thing as Contacts. You must choose a sphere of Influence for each dot of Influence, and each sphere is tracked separately. The spheres are also tracked independently for each area (Fremont, SFFC, Victoria, Yerba Buena). If you influence in a sphere but not a geographical area or the reverse, the difficulty is +2. The spheres are:<ul>
      <li>Bureaucratic: represents your character’s sway over mortal government institutions on a city level and allows you to do things such as trace utility bills, acquire fake documentation such as driver’s licenses, passports, etc., and even get small areas of the city rezoned. It also represents the amount of sway your character has over the political goings-on of the city and allows you to do things such as lobby a politician, garner inside information on processes, sway or alter local political projects, and enact legislation.</li>
      <li>Corporate: represents the amount of power your character holds over the industrial side of things in the city and allows you to do things such as arrange small accidents or sabotage, organize minor strikes, and close down or revitalize small plants. It also represents the amount of power your character has over the financial institutions of the city and allows you to do things such as raise capital, trace account activity, and even ruin business’ credit ratings</li>
      <li>Legal: represents your character’s sway over the legal proceedings in the city and allows you to do things such as get free representation, have minor charges dropped, manipulate civil cases, issue subpoenas and have deportation proceedings held against someone. It also represents the amount of pull your character has over the local police forces and allows you to do things such as avoid traffic stops, access minor evidence that “goes missing”, get copies of an investigation report, access confiscated weapons or contraband, and arrange a setup.</li>
      <li>Media and Social Events: represents your character’s pull over the news sources of the city and allows you to do things such as learn about stories early, suppress small articles or reports, ground stories and projects, boost or erode someone’s fame background and spread fake news locally. It also represents your character’s pull over the higher echelons of society - celebrities, old money families like the Rockefellers and even new money families all fill this niche. Media and Social Events influence allows you to do things like gain access to exclusive events, gain access to locations, and even score tickets.</li>
      <li>Street and Underworld: represents the pull your character has over gangs and the homeless and allows you to do things such as identify most gangs and their turf, access contraband, arrange services from street people, mobilize groups of homeless people, and arrange an impressive protest by street people. It also represents your character’s pull within the criminal society and allows you to do things such as locate contraband and illicit activities, obtain untraceable guns, drugs, stolen cars, etc., arrange a minor hit, arrange gangland assassinations, and supply sizable drug needs for the city</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Generation:</strong> A vampire's Generation denotes how far removed from Caine that given character is. With no points spent in Generation, a vampire (in the 1800s) would be 12th Generation; with five points spent, that same vampire would be 7th Generation. Generation has a couple of major effects; older Generation (that is, closer to Caine) have higher maximum trait ratings, have a larger Blood Pool (see below), and can spend more Blood Points per turn. Older Generation vampires cannot be Dominated (a Discipline) by Younger Generation vampire (although vampires of the same Generation can Dominate one another). As an example of the differences between older and younger Generations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A 7th Generation vampire can have a maximum trait rating of 6 (which gives access to additional disciplines, and to again use the example of strength, would allow a vampire to lift 600 lbs or throw a motorcycle, have a maximum Blood Pool of 20, and spend 4 Blood Points per Turn).</li>
  <li>A 12th Generation vampire has a maximum trait rating of 5, a Blood Pool of 11, and can spend but a single Blood Point per Turn.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Haven:</strong> See <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Havens">Havens</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Herd:</strong> Herd is the number "Vessels" (humans from which to feed) that you can feed from without fear. This could be a cult of worshippers, or patients in your hospital, whatever. When you need to Hunt to feed and replenish your Blood Pool, you normally roll your Perception trait against the target difficulty (varying from 4 to 8); Herd adds one die to this roll per point and in appropriate circumstances (i.e., how you've defined your Herd) may allow for automatic success. See also <a href="/VtM/Silver-and-Gold/Rules/Backgrounds">Hunting</a>. Your herd might come in handy for minor tasks, though they are typically not very controllable, closely connected to you, or particularly skilled (for more effective pawns, see Allies or Retainers)</p>
<p><strong>Status, Clan Prestige, and Anarch Reputation:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Status - This is a Kindred's place among all vampires. It cuts across boundaries between the Camarilla and the Sabbat (although that isn't always good). Princes and Primogen have Status, as to very Elder Kindred. High Status vampires can expect a certain amount of deference from lower Status ones, at least within the same organization (i.e., a high Status Prince wouldn't expect run-of-the-mill Sabbat to treat them well).</li>
  <li>Clan Prestige - This reflects how well received a vampire is by his own Clan. Most vampire have only status in their own Clan, however, and something truly exceptional has to be done to earn the favor of another. Also, Clan Prestige is not related to a vampires Status; a vampire can have a highly respected role within their Clan but be relatively unknown within larger Kindred society. Clan Status, depending on the Clan, may provide certain benefits and is earned in different ways:<ul>
      <li>Brujah: Clan prestige is earned by participating in fights with Clan members (either by aiding them or sparring with them). Clan prestige can be useful when you need a few extra Brujah for a good fight.</li>
      <li>Gangrel: Clan prestige is earned by sparring or boasting of deeds. Clan prestige can be used to provide aid, either in the former of other Gangrel or animals under their control.</li>
      <li>Malkavian: The Malkavians don't use prestige like other clans do; they instead have access to the Madness Network.</li>
      <li>The Ministry: Setites earn prestige within the Clan by spreading the worship of Set. Clan Prestige can be used to get access to resources of corruption and temptation (drugs, guns, tribbles)</li>
      <li>Nosferatu: Nosferatu earn and use Clan Prestige the same way; by accessing the Nosferatu Intelligence Network (NIN).</li>
      <li>Ravnos: Ravnos are rare in this campaign. While they do have Clan Prestige, it is unusual for them to be able to make effective use of it.</li>
      <li>Toreador: Throw a great party, and gain prestige. Want to be invited to a great party? You need to have prestige.</li>
      <li>Tremere: Tremere traffick in magicks and occult knowledge. Providing it grants one prestige. Having prestige grants one access to greater mysteries.</li>
      <li>Ventrue: Ventrue remain the Kindred with the most influence in the upper echelons of mortal society. Prestige, both the gain of and benefits of having is therefore closely tied to influence with Kine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Anarch Reputation - This is a measure of one's reputation within the local community of Anarchs. Status among the Anarchs reflects memorable deeds and general popularity.</li>
</ul>
