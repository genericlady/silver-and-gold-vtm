<p><u>From the V20 RAW</u></p>
<p>The Blood Hunt — the Lextalionis — is the Princely decree that declares another vampire persona non grata. The right of Princes (or “elders,” depending upon the interpretation of the Tradition) to call the Blood Hunt effectively forfeits the hunted Kindred’s unlife; it is the ultimate punishment levied for the most grievous of crimes. Indeed, it is used so sparing and so severely in most domains that many Princes will even pardon those Kindred who perform diablerie on a vampire under the Lextalionis.</p>
<p>AND</p>
<p>When a vampire is found guilty of high crimes (such as an egregious breach of the Masquerade, the diablerie of another Kindred, or offending the Prince), the Prince can call for the Lextalionis – the dreaded blood hunt. The Prince declares the hunt in his court, and the word filters down through his Primogen to the Clans. All who hear the call must participate (although “participation” can simply mean staying out of the way when the hunters come through). Once in a while such a hunt is called to hound the criminal Kindred into exile outside the city’s borders, but more often than not the hunt only ends when the hunted suffers the Final Death. Some Princes even turn a blind eye to the act of Amaranth during such a hunt.</p>
<p><u>From the whitewolf.fandom.com wiki:</u></p>
<p>The traditional legal institution behind the Blood Hunt is the <i>Lextalionis</i> (or <i>Lex Talionis</i>), a legal principle that can be summarized as "an eye for an eye". Such an order is usually given whenever a Kindred has committed a serious offense, such as kinslaying, diablerie, breaching the Masquerade, invasion of domain that has resulted in any of the above offenses, repeated defiance of authority of the Prince, or any other behavior that a Prince deems to be a sufficient threat to the safety of the Masquerade and the Kindred of the city as a whole.</p>
<p>Any Kindred who hears the order for a Blood Hunt is expected to participate, although she is not <i>required</i> unless the Kindred in question has committed truly serious offenses (such as deliberately or repeatedly violating the Masquerade). Typically, the damned have until midnight to escape the city. If they do not, then they are open to retribution by their fellow Kindred. Any Kindred who provides assistance to the target of a Blood Hunt will often become the next to be hunted.</p>
<p>Some vampires use the Blood Hunt as a time to settle scores and get rid of rivals and enemies, and no few vampires have indulged in the chance to commit diablerie on their target or on other vampires who had the misfortune to get caught in the crossfire. Princes also have been known to use the Blood Hunt as a means to eliminate political or personal opposition as well, although this is, strictly speaking, forbidden, and the misuse of the Blood Hunt can have severe consequences on the prince in the long term.</p>
<p>The Sixth Tradition, the Tradition of Destruction, is used as the legal pretext for enacting the Lextalionis. Since the advent of the sects, Kindred are often subject to the Blood Hunt for aiding and abetting the Sabbat, or for subverting the Camarilla's hegemony in some other fashion. The Sabbat does not exactly practice the Blood Hunt, per se, as the sect disregards the Traditions in favor of the Code of Milan. When the Sword of Caine invokes the Lextalionis, it instead calls for a Wild Hunt on the unfortunate target; the early Anarchs who preceded the Sabbat used the Wild Hunt in a similar fashion.</p>
