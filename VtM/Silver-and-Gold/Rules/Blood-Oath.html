<p>An old ritual of an unknown origin, The Blood Oath--also known as the Pinky Swear--is a way to foster cooperation among coteries, especially those made up of primarily neonates. The coterie, together, each pledges loyalty to the group (the exact pledge varies, but it must be identical for all the members) while holding a knife. They then, one at a time, slice one of their pinkies from their hand and squeeze a drop of blood from it into a cup. The severing of the finger causes a blood point's worth of damage but is easily healed as normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All those who bled into the cup then repeat the pledge of loyalty to together, and then take a drink from the cup. If anyone refuses at this point, there is no effect. Otherwise, a supernatural bond forms, not unlike a blood bond, but with the following effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It provides a sense of loyalty to the coterie as a whole. Individual animosities and deeper friendships can still form, but each member is loyal to the group and won't willingly choose to betray or attack it. It does not create the sense of affection or the “crush” associated with a blood bond.</li>
  <li>Each member has a weak empathic connection to the others. If anyone in the coterie experiences strong emotions (such as if they were fighting for their life), the other members can sense it. Additionally, it gives a “hot or cold" sense of direction and intensity, allowing members--given time--to locate the other members of the coterie, although it only works reliably when the sought member is under the sway of those strong emotions. (Roll Wits+Awareness, Difficutly varies (4-9 depending on emotional intensity).</li>
  <li>There is one other benefit, which may or may not be discovered by the group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike blood bonds (except full bonds), a Kindred can only engage in one Blood Oath at any time. The Oath fades if the Kindred has no contact with any of their coterie for (12-Willpower) months. Pinky swearing with mortals in this manner does not create a blood oath.</p>
<p>Examples of oaths:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I swear before this coterie that I shall fight to the death for you. If any member of this coterie falls, I will take their place, and fight as they would have fought. If anyone here should see me take of weak heart, and run away, they will remind me of this pledge, made here before my coterie.</li>
  <li>I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the coterie against all enemies, be they Kindred, Kine, or otherwise; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge my duties to the coterie for which I have sworn this oath.</li>
  <li>I swear that I will be faithful to the coterie. When they call, I shall come. Neither by word, nor deed, nor action shall I betray their trust. Their pain shall be mine to suffer. When they are in danger, I shall protect them. When they are in need, they may come to me for a surcease. This I swear.</li>
  <li>When the visions around you, bring tears to your eyes. And all that surrounds you, are secrets and lies. I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope. Keeping your faith when it's gone. The one you should call, was standing here all along. And I will take, you in my arms, and hold you right where you belong. Till the day my life is through, this I promise you. This I promise you. (This particular oath requires Dexterity + Performance[Dance] to get the choreography right.)</li>
</ul>
