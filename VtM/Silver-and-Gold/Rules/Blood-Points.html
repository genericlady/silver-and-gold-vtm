<ul>
  <li>Vitae isn't blood itself, but the part of the blood that provides the supernatural force that animates a vampire.</li>
  <li>The blood of other Kindred, especially elders (the older the generation the better) is the most potent and tastes the best.</li>
  <li>The blood of Kine is nearly as potent (when fresh) as that of a typical vampire, even if it's not as delectable.</li>
  <li>The blood of other creatures doesn't contain nearly as much supernatural vitae and is barely palatable.</li>
  <li>Obviously, drinking directly from the source provides the sweetest vitae.</li>
  <li>Blood taken from kine or kindred (except very old generation kindred) that is transferred to a container without any special preparation retains its potency for a single scene.</li>
  <li>Blood from kine that is bottled or otherwise preserved usually loses about a third of its potency and almost all of its flavor. Effectively, three wine bottles of blood = 1 Blood Point.</li>
  <li>Blood taken from kindred that is bottled or preserved will last indefinitely, provided that it is not exposed to fire or sunlight. The flavor takes on different characteristics over time. One bottle of wine holds the equivalent of one blood point, unless it is from a vampire of 6th Generation or older.</li>
  <li>With the exception of certain rituals or magical means, a Kindred does not receive any sustenance from drinking their own blood, however stored.</li>
  <li>Kindred that feed from poisoned or drugged subjects can be affected by the substances in that subject's blood. In our game, the primary drugs and effects are as follows:<ul>
      <li>Alcohol: For every 2 drinks (rounding down) in the subject's system, the vampire loses one die from dice pools involving Intelligence or Dexterity. The effect fades at 1 die / scene and ends completely after a day's rest. Alcohol is very common.</li>
      <li>Hallucinogens: All dice pools are lowered by 1 to 3 dice. Vampire is affected by sensory hallucinations. Vampire receives one extra level of Auspex (or one level if they do not have the discipline); however, they are unable to consciously control the power (it turns on and off at random). Effects last 8-Stamina hours (minimum 1 hour). Hallucinogens are very uncommon in general.</li>
      <li>Marijuana: Vampire experiences an altered perception of time; Perception rolls reduced by 1. Difficulties to Frenzy rolls reduced by 1. Effects last a single scene. Marijuana is uncommon.</li>
      <li>Opium: Vampire experiences a dreamlike state for 12-Stamina hours. Subtract 2 dice from Dexterity rolls and subtract an additional 2 dice all Ability rolls for one scene. Difficulty to Frenzy rolls reduced by 1. Opium is uncommon to common.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Drinking blood, a refresher:<ul>
      <li>In general, as soon as the Kindred breaks her subject's skin with her fangs, all resistance ceases. This is true even if in combat. Some mortals (especially strong-willed ones) can continue to resist for a time. Other Kindred can also resist the Kiss&nbsp;on a Self-Control / Instincts roll at Difficulty 8.</li>
      <li>A vampire may drink up to 3 points per turn (although that's not as much fun as drawing it out slowly and savoring it).</li>
      <li>20% of a subject's current blood pool (adjusting for injuries) can be drank safely. Each point after that requires the subject attempt a soak roll; soaking all the additional points means the subject is stable. Failing to soak the additional points means the subject needs medical attention. A botch means the subject has died. At 50% of the current blood pool, the subject requires hospitalization. Each point past 50% requires the subject attempt to soak the damage, as above, except that success only means they don't immediately die. Failure or botching means they die immediately.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Spending blood, another refresher<ul>
      <li>A vampire may spend as many blood points per turn as their generation allows. They may spend these blood points in different ways up to their limit.</li>
      <li>Healing:<ul>
          <li>A vampire may heal one health level of bashing or lethal damage per blood point per turn. This requires either that the vampire be completely at rest OR they must succeed on a Stamina + Survival roll (Difficulty 8). Failing means all expended blood points were lost without effect, botch also costs an additional blood point AND an additional wound.</li>
          <li>A vampire may heal one level of aggravated damage for 5 blood points; this requires a full day of rest. A vampire may heal additionally levels of aggravated damage on the same day with the expenditure of 5 additional blood points AND 1 Willpower point.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Attribute increase:<ul>
          <li>A vampire may spend increase any physical attribute or combination of physical attributes by spending 1 point per dot of increase, to their per turn maximum. Attributes can be increased to 1 above their normal maximum. This lasts the entire scene.</li>
          <li>Alternatively, they can be raised up to 3 above their normal maximum; however, this requires the vampire to keep spending the appropriate number of blood points each turn. This ends 3 turns after the blood is no longer spent.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Blush of life<ul>
          <li>A vampire may appear to be human by spending (8-Humanity) blood points. This allows the vampire to have warm, flush skin, draw breath, even engage in sexual intercourse. This lasts a scene.</li>
          <li>Vampires with Humanity 8 or higher can do this without spending any blood points, but still must consciously do it (i.e., it isn't automatic).</li>
          <li>Vampires on an alternate path (i.e., something other than the Path of Humanity) can never do this.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Oh, and one more important thing: when rolling Self-Control (or Instinct) to see if you Frenzy, you may never roll more dice than you have in your Blood Pool. Hunger's a bitch.</li>
</ul>
<p>(This is the old stuff. I need to edit this page.)</p>
<p>Blood Pool: This is a measure of how much blood, or vitae, that a vampire has in their system. A normal human mortal has a pool of 10 points; vampires, especially elder ones, frequently have larger pools not because they have more blood, but because they cause it to be concentrated and more potent. A vampire with an empty pool is ravenously hungry and likely about to enter Frenzy. Every night, whether or not they rise, one point is subtracted from the pool (except in Torpor; vampires in Torpor expend no blood). Blood points may only be replenished through consuming blood. Vampires can use the blood within them in a variety of ways by spending Blood points from their pool; most younger generation Kindred can spend one point per turn, whereas elders can spend several. It should be noted that whenever a vampire needs to make a roll against their Self-Control, they cannot use more dice than they have current blood points in their pool; hungry vampires are not known for their exercise of restraint.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Points can be used as follows:<ul>
      <li>To heal normal (not aggravated) damage, at a cost of one point per level of damage. Note that this is a rapid process but the vampire must remain relatively inactive while healing. Note also that this the ONLY way to heal damage; vampires do not otherwise heal normally.</li>
      <li>To increase a physical attribute (Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina) on a point for point basis. A vampire may increase an attribute one point above the normal limit for their Generation (so a 12th Generation vampire may increase their strength all the way to 6) for the duration of an entire Scene (see below); they may increase it all the way up to 10 by spending sufficient points, but the points above the maximum (as listed above) disappear a mere three turns after they stop spending blood points from their pool.</li>
      <li>They may feed blood to another vampire, allowing them to heal and potentially creating a blood bond with them.</li>
      <li>They may feed blood to a moral or a animal, creating a ghoul (and again, potentially creating a blood bond).</li>
      <li>They may use it to appear as a living human again, as noted in Humanity, above. This costs a number of points equal to 8 minus Humanity.</li>
      <li>Certain disciplines also require blood points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Points are regained from feeding on others. As noted, healthy human mortals have 10 points in their pool; drinking more than 20% (2 points) is risky; 50% (5 points) requires immediate hospitalization. Vampires may drink up to 3 points per turn but usually savor the experience, which is pleasurable for both vampire and mortal. A vampire can lick the wounds created by their fangs, causing them to immediately heal. Vampires can also choose to feed on animals, but their blood is not nearly as nutritious; an entire cow, drained dry, only provides 5 points of blood. Vampires can also drink from other Kindred, and the blood of elders is especially potent; in fact, draining an elder completely and then drinking until their life force is extinguished will permanently make the imbiber take on the older Generation, thus becoming more powerful. This practice is called Diablerie, and in the Camarilla is considered a grave crime punishable by final death.</li>
  <li>Vampires may feed from animals, but their blood is not especially nourishing; even large animals with a higher quantity of blood than a human mortal contains but a fraction of the nourishment as that same mortal's blood.</li>
  <li>Vampires may feed from the recently deceased (generally within the same scene), but old blood and the blood of corpses has no value.</li>
</ul>
