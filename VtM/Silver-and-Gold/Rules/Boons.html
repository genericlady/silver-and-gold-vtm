<p><strong>Boons in the World of Darkness</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>The world of vampires has a currency just like any other, but vampires are not generally that impressed with cold hard cash. They deal in something a bit more complicated, boons.<br>&nbsp;<br>A boon is like a debt. You do someone a favor, and if they acknowledge that you helped them out, they now owe you a boon. Sounds pretty simple, but nothing in the world of darkness is ever simple when you take everything into account.<br><br>Also understand that a boon isn’t owed just when you take it upon yourself to declare it. If someone saves your existence by choice, and others see him do so, if you don’t acknowledge the boon, the court may destroy you. If a vampire becomes known as untrustworthy or an oath breaker, the Chancellor may allow others to ignore their debt to him later. (And it becomes very hard to trade in boons in any event.)<br>&nbsp;<br>One thing to remember is that boons must be paid off because the social order demands it. If a Prince doesn’t enforce boons, then the people who owe him boons might not have to pay him off, and he isn’t going to tolerate that.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, if the boon isn’t formally acknowledged, the social order will not force the boon to be paid off, it’s as simple as that. Of course, some principled vampires will repay their debt just because they choose to honor the system of prestation, but it’s not a good idea to rely on principle in this harsh world.</p>
<p><i><strong>Justicar decisions regarding Boons:</strong></i></p>
<ul>
  <li>A boon owned (not owed) by a slain Kindred may be transferred to the Kindred's Childe or Sire, as determined by the Chancellor.</li>
  <li>A boon owed (a debt) by a Kindred who has died of their own volition or through misfortune (i.e., not by the act, direct, indirect, or otherwise, of another Kindred) may also be transferred to the Kindred's Childe or Sire, or be nullified, as determined by the Chancellor.</li>
  <li>For Kindred who have disappeared, or whose status is unknown and cannot be determined, a Chancellor may appoint an executor to administer all boons, owed and owned. That executor is not the actual boon-holder, however, they may petition the Chancellor to adjudicate any matters regarding the boon as if the executor did indeed hold the boon in question, either as owner or debtor.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>Ok so I owe a boon. Just what is required of me now?</strong></i><br>&nbsp;<br>(Depending on where you look, the way these boons are described is different. This is the way we do it here; at least this way it’s consistent.)<br>&nbsp;<br>Since boons are so important, boons are carefully described in two ways. First, in what would be done for you to owe the boon, and second, in how you can repay the boon.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Trivial Boon</strong></p>
          <p>A trivial boon is a one-time or simple favor, e.g., acting as a security escort for an evening to dissuade would be attackers, aiding someone’s effort by use of a Discipline, or supporting someone’s political move at little political risk to oneself</p>
          <p>A small boon like this doesn’t mean that the person who did you the favor inconvenienced himself while helping you, just that he helped you. He might trade information and demand a boon.</p>
          <p>A trivial boon is paid off with one action, and never requires anything of that character again. It requires that the player use a discipline on the other’s behalf, or that he votes on his behalf, or perhaps that he supplies a piece of information. If a person chooses not to repay the boon when he could do so, he can usually get away with it, but the harpies or Prince might use this as an excuse to destroy his status in such a case.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Minor Boon</strong></p>
          <p>A minor boon is a longer or more involved favor that can last more than a single evening and probably entails some kind of real inconvenience, e.g., safe passage through and/or short term safe lodging in a hostile city; revealing crucial information; disposing of a threat with little risk to oneself. If another person inconveniences himself on your behalf, giving up part of a limited resource, then a minor boon is appropriate.</p>
          <p>A minor boon is still generally paid off with one action, even though the “action” might continue for some time. While the boon is held, the one who owes should be polite and not insult the other in public, but that doesn’t mean he has to agree with him. Where with a trivial boon one can choose not to repay and only risking status, when someone comes to collect a minor boon, you’d better pay. A minor boon could be paid by allowing someone to use your haven for a long period of time, or by guaranteeing their safety in a domain you already control. A minor boon can be paid off by instructing another in a discipline which is common, like Auspex, Dominate, or Presence.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Major Boon</strong></p>
          <p>A major boon involves a great expenditure of time or resources, usually lasting for many game sessions, e.g., purchasing a nightclub to serve as a haven for the recipient. It could also entail a dangerous favor with high likelihood of mild or moderate injury, or a more than trivial chance of serious injury or personal disaster.</p>
          <p>A major boon is owed when the person sacrificed greatly of his time or resources, and subjected himself to a certain amount of risk.</p>
          <p>A boon can be repaid by teaching the other hidden lore or how to perform a clan discipline. Certain disciplines, like Thaumaturgy and Quietus, generally count as a life boon. At this level you must support any political action the possessor of the boon desires, even against your own clan, but this negates the debt.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><strong>Life Boon</strong></p>
          <p>This type of boon is a favor so dangerous that the bestower actively risks his or her own life (figuratively or concretely) so that the recipient can live, even if the bestower doesn’t, e.g., single handedly holding off a pack of Sabbat inside a burning building so that the recipient can make a clean getaway, charging into a fight against a clearly superior force of Sabbat or Lupines, a Prince sparing a newly released Neonate’s life after the Neonate has breached the Masquerade. A life boon may only be claimed if the claimer of the boon truly laid his very existence on the line. Fighting clearly inferior opponents does not count.</p>
          <p>The possessor may demand anything that he likes, anything. A life boon is a truly terrible debt, which might not ever be repaid. While it is owed, you may never vote against the owner’s interests, you may never speak directly against him, and you must teach him when he requests it. (And if he demands your political support, he will get it. If giving such support actually endangers your life in a real way, the debt is now paid.) If he demands dark clan secrets, like Thaumaturgy, teaching him such negates the debt. If you risk your existence to save the owner of the boon, the debt is canceled. This debt is only repaid by saving the life of he who owes the boon (or the equivalent). He may demand anything short of that and get it, and you still owe him.</p>

<p><br><i><strong>Always Read The Fine Print</strong></i><br>&nbsp;<br>One of the interesting things about boons is that if you should kill kindred, and that kindred owed a boon, you now owe that boon in turn. Twisted isn’t it?<br>&nbsp;<br>Certain enterprising kindred have even taken out such boons, knowing that someone hunting them might elect not to kill them, simply because they don’t want to pick up the boon.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, this doesn’t matter in the case of a blood hunt, or someone killed by a member of the court expressly doing his or her job. (Like Justicars or Archons.) The boon disappears.<br>&nbsp;<br>Finally, also remember that this is all enforced by the Chancellor and the Prince. If both the Chancellor and the Prince hate you, then you’d best step very carefully when interpreting your boons. On the other hand, if enough people like you, they might not consider something to be worthy of a boon. Popularity is a very good thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>The other thing to remember is that the worst time to be seen as ignoring your boons is when someone else already has. The more the rules are trod upon, the more likely the Prince is to lash out, possibly invoking the Tradition of Destruction. As his domain is seen to be lawless, his power weakens. (But even the first time might be the last, should the Prince be in a bad mood.)</p>
<p><i><strong>Eligible Parties of a Transaction:</strong></i></p>
<p>Only released Kindred may enter into the exchange of boons and prestation. Unreleased childer are considered the property of their sires and as such may not owe or be owed debts of prestation. If an unreleased childe performs an act on behalf of someone, the resulting boon is owed to the sire, not the childe. In addition, Ghouls, mortals, etc. may neither owe nor be owed debts of prestation; however, in the case of Ghouls any task they undertake for another Kindred may incur boons owed to their Domitor.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i><strong>Examples</strong></i><br>Delacroix the Malkavian, new in town, doesn’t find shelter from the sun in time. Another kindred sees him, and lets him use his haven. This is a trivial boon, because he didn’t really give anything up to help you. Later he asked for an introduction to the Prince of the city whom the traveling vampire is from, and the debt is paid.<br>&nbsp;<br>Later Delacroix sees a neonate being menaced by a young Brujah. He drives off the other vampire easily. The neonate now owes a minorboon to Delacroix. It would have been more than that if the Brujah was a threat, or if by opposing them he angered the Brujah Prince of the City. For some time the debt goes unpaid, until the time comes that Delacroix asks for instruction in Fortitude, a fairly common discipline in the area. Teaching is given, and now the debt is negated.</p>
<p>Years later Delacroix finds a member of the local Primogen being attacked by Garou. After a desperate fight, he manages to kill one Garou and drag the Primogen away, who is in torpor. This is a life boon, since he unquestionably saved his life. From now on, in any vote that Delacroix is involved he votes for him, teaches him anything he needs to, and offers him haven.</p>
