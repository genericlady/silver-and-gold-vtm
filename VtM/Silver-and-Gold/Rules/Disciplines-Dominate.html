<p>Dominate is one of the most dreaded of Disciplines. It is a vampire’s ability to influence another person’s thoughts and actions through her own force of will. Dominate requires that the vampire capture her victim’s gaze; as such, it may be used against only one subject at a time. Further, commands must be issued verbally, although simple orders may be made with signs — for example, a pointed finger and forceful expression to indicate “Go!” However, the subject won’t comply if he can’t understand the vampire, no matter how powerful the Kindred’s will is. (from saligia.fandom.com)</p>
<p>House rule:</p>
<p>According to the RAW, the first level of Dominate, Command, allows the vampire to give a one-word command that the target must obey (within certain preconditions). The command word may be couched in a sentence and only slightly emphasized, but the RAW holds that only the single word has any meaning. However, as noted previously, this fails to account that not all languages are equal, and the single word nature of Command is more restrictive in English than it is in (for example) Japanese or Turkish*. Further, despite the indications to the contrary, the target must be able to process some level of context; consider the command, “Play;" should the target engage in activity for enjoyment or give a musical performance? What about the command “Come," for which a non-contextual response can have very different consequences.</p>
<p>Therefore, Command will allow short, simple sentences consisting of (at most) a subject, verb, object or objects, and appropriate descriptor, and the target, while on autopilot, still retains and processes the contextual cues for the situation. For example, these can all be used as Commands:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yell</li>
  <li>Sit down</li>
  <li>Drop the gun</li>
  <li>Give me your keys</li>
  <li>Remove her gag</li>
</ul>
<p>It is still possible to contain the Command within a larger sentence as well, emphasizing only the command word / words:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you think I'm right, <i>shout my name.</i></li>
  <li>Gentlemen, there's no need to <i>fight over me.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The more successes you achieve on your Manipulation + Intimidation roll, the more closely the target will follow the spirit (vs the letter) of your Command. Keep in mind that the command must still be understandable to the subject, and the more ambiguous the Command, the less likely you will achieve your desire result. Also keep in mind that the effect is instantaneous; although with more successes, that effect may endure for a longer period. For example, achieving a single success with the Command to “Drop the gun," will have the subject immediately drop the gun they are holding, but they may also pick it up right afterwards. On the other hand, getting five successes on the roll may have them drop the gun and not even consider picking it back up for the rest of the scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>* In Japanese, context is extremely important in conversations. For example, although one could literally say, “I am giving you this book," a fluent speaker wouldn't say this; they would simply hold out the book and say the word for “give." In Turkish, the words are agglutinative, where many words or word particles can be joined into a single word, such as “<i>Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınızcasına."</i></p>
