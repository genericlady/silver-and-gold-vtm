<p>Dominate is one of the most dreaded of Disciplines. It is a vampire’s ability to influence another person’s thoughts and actions through her own force of will. Dominate requires that the vampire capture her victim’s gaze; as such, it may be used against only one subject at a time. Further, commands must be issued verbally, although simple orders may be made with signs — for example, a pointed finger and forceful expression to indicate “Go!” However, the subject won’t comply if he can’t understand the vampire, no matter how powerful the Kindred’s will is. (from saligia.fandom.com)</p>
<p>Note that, unlike Presence, victims of Dominate are not acting of their own free will. The Kindred is compelling the actions. There are certain side effects to this, namely that if the Kindred tries to make the subject perform a task that requires more than simple (subconscious) cognition, the task will likely fail. Anything that requires the subject to intentionally access their memory to recall something will thus usually fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>“Flee!" - The subject will open doors to get away from the Kindred, as the learned behavior of how to open a door does not typically require more than simple cognition.</li>
  <li>“Go outside!” - If the subject knows (or believes they know) which way “outside” is, they will immediately head in that direction. If they don't have any idea which way to go (i.e., brought blindfolded to an underground chamber), they will either pick a direction randomly or the command will fail, based on their Nature and the situation.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>“Sign this paper." - This works, as writing one's signature requires minimal recall and cognition.</li>
  <li>“Tell me the combination to your safe.” - This will fail, as it requires them to access their memory and then recite the combination.</li>
  <li>“Open your safe.” - This will probably succeed, unless they routinely have to refer to something to access the combination. The act of opening something I know how to open requires less cognitive effort and active recall of memory than reciting the combination.</li>
  <li>“Tell me what you know about the Prince.” - This will fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that Dominate cannot be simply used for interrogation. It can, however be used in conjunction with interrogation.</p>
<p>Subjects of Dominate usually remember everything that happened, unless “Forgetful Mind” is used. However, see “Rationalize," below.</p>
<p>House rule:</p>
<p>According to the RAW, the first level of Dominate, Command, allows the vampire to give a one-word command that the target must obey (within certain preconditions). The command word may be couched in a sentence and only slightly emphasized, but the RAW holds that only the single word has any meaning. However, as noted previously, this fails to account that not all languages are equal, and the single word nature of Command is more restrictive in English than it is in (for example) Japanese or Turkish*. Further, despite the indications to the contrary, the target must be able to process some level of context; consider the command, “Play;" should the target engage in activity for enjoyment or give a musical performance? What about the command “Come," for which a non-contextual response can have very different consequences.</p>
<p>Therefore, Command will allow short, simple sentences consisting of (at most) a subject, verb, object or objects, and appropriate descriptor, and the target, while on autopilot, still retains and processes the contextual cues for the situation. For example, these can all be used as Commands:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Yell</li>
  <li>Sit down</li>
  <li>Drop the gun</li>
  <li>Give me your keys</li>
  <li>Remove her gag</li>
</ul>
<p>It is still possible to contain the Command within a larger sentence as well, emphasizing only the command word / words:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you think I'm right, <i>shout my name.</i></li>
  <li>Gentlemen, there's no need to <i>fight over me.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The more successes you achieve on your Manipulation + Intimidation roll, the more closely the target will follow the spirit (vs the letter) of your Command. Keep in mind that the command must still be understandable to the subject, and the more ambiguous the Command, the less likely you will achieve your desire result. Also keep in mind that the effect is instantaneous; although with more successes, that effect may endure for a longer period. For example, achieving a single success with the Command to “Drop the gun," will have the subject immediately drop the gun they are holding, but they may also pick it up right afterwards. On the other hand, getting five successes on the roll may have them drop the gun and not even consider picking it back up for the rest of the scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>House rule:</p>
<p>As a 4-dot power of Dominate, you may choose Rationalize. This affects all Dominate powers (unless its not applicable). Rationalize makes the subject retroactively believe that the actions they took due to Dominate were a result of their own free will. If questioned about their actions, they will defend said actions unless strong evidence to the contrary is presented, and even then they must roll Will vs Will against the Kindred that Dominated them (or the original number of successes on the Dominate).&nbsp;</p>

<p>* In Japanese, context is extremely important in conversations. For example, although one could literally say, “I am giving you this book," a fluent speaker wouldn't say this; they would simply hold out the book and say the word for “give." In Turkish, the words are agglutinative, where many words or word particles can be joined into a single word, such as “<i>Çekoslovakyalılaştıramadıklarımızdanmışsınızcasına."</i></p>
