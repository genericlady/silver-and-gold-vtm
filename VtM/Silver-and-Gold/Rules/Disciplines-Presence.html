<p>Presence is the Discipline of emotional manipulation. Vampires with this power can inspire passionate fervor or unreasoning terror in mortals and Kindred alike. In addition, unlike most Disciplines, some of Presence’s powers can be used on entire crowds at one time. Presence can transcend race, religion, gender, class, and (most importantly) supernatural nature. As such, this subtle power is one of the most useful Disciplines a vampire can possess.</p>
<p>Anyone can resist Presence for one scene by spending a Willpower point and succeeding on a Willpower roll (difficulty 8), but the affected individual must keep spending points until he is no longer in the presence of the vampire (or, in the case of Summon, until the effect wears off). Vampires three or more Generations lower than the wielder need only spend a single Willpower to ignore the Presence for an entire night and need not roll Willpower to do so.</p>
<p>The major drawback of Presence is that it controls only the emotions. It causes others to feel a certain way toward the vampire, but does not give her outright control over them. While people weigh strongly the orders that the vampire declares, their minds are still their own. Suicidal or ridiculous directives don’t sound any more sensible just because the person giving them is unusually fascinating. Still, inspired eloquence or significant wealth used in combination with this Discipline can enable the vampire to urge others along a desired course.</p>
<p>Can Presence be used in combat? Generally no, as Presence is mostly a social power that controls or sways emotions. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;Awe and Daunt (1-dot powers) might be useful immediately before, during lulls, or to prematurely end combat, but otherwise are not useable in combat.</li>
  <li>Dread Gaze can be used in combat; however, it is still only useful on a single subject at a time and requires a turn to use it (as per RAW).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Entrancement cannot be used in combat.</li>
  <li>Majesty can be used in combat; however, it's effects are dependent on what the Kindred (and possibly other coterie members) using it does next. From the RAW: “Majesty inspires universal respect, devotion, fear — or all those emotions at once — in those around the vampire. The weak scramble to obey her every whim, and even the most dauntless find it almost impossible to deny her. People affected find the vampire so formidable that they dare not risk her displeasure. Raising their voices to her is difficult; raising a hand against her is unthinkable…” However, none of this says that those effected will lay down and willingly allow themselves to be killed. A cornered rat might still fight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Entrancement - A closer look</h2>
<p>Per the RAW:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Entrancement] bends others’ emotions, making them the vampire’s willing servants. Due to what these individuals see as true and enduring devotion, they heed the vampire’s every desire. Since this is done willingly, instead of having their wills sapped, these servants retain their creativity and individuality. While these obedient minions are more personable and spirited than the mind-slaves created by Dominate, they’re also somewhat unpredictable. Further, since Entrancement is of a temporary duration, dealing with a lapsed servant can be troublesome. A wise Kindred either disposes of those she Entrances after they serve their usefulness, or binds them more securely by a blood bond (made much easier by the minion’s willingness to serve).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first important thing to note is that Entrancement <i>isn't</i> Dominate, and does not give a Kindred control over an Entranced subject. Dominated subjects obey commands; Entranced willing subjects choose to do things for the vampire that that has entranced them. Someone who is entranced may see the vampire as the love of their life, their new best friend, their parent, their child, or whatever relationship might predominate their thoughts, depending on their background and nature. &nbsp;However, unlike someone who has been blood bonded, an entranced subject does <i>not</i> forget or forego all other relationships. How the subject acts is very much dependent on the individual subject. Consider the following (taken from http://www.kismetrose.com/vtm/sc/disciplines/Disciplines18.html)</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This power creates a need in the mind of the target, a need to please the vampire. It becomes a dominant but not driving need in the mind of the target. At best, the target will obey the vampire's commands and try to please the vampire in all ways; at worst, the target will try to "please" the vampire in such a way that the vampire suffers some collateral damage. The need manifests according to the Nature of the victim. A Child Nature would become obedient and compliant, treating the vampire as a parent to be obeyed; a rebel would think (not really think, but feel and act as if) the vampire were a high up man in his rebellion, or a sympathizer, or perhaps someone whose advice could be trusted, even if he was an establishment stooge. Note how the Child is much more likely to obey a command than the Rebel is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As noted, an entranced subject still has free will and does not jettison all other meaningful relationships automatically. This means that, while someone who is entranced might be convinced to divorce their spouse in favor of this sudden new whirlwind affair, they aren't going to murder them in cold blood.</p>

<h2>House rules</h2>
<p><strong>Awe: </strong>In addition to the active use of the power, the Kindred may add their Presence rating to Persuasion and Performance rolls against single individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Daunt: </strong>1-dot power, similar to the active effect of Awe except that it repels instead of attracts. In addition to the active use of the power, the Kindred may add their Presence rating to Intimidation checks against single individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Dread Gaze: </strong>Despite the flavor text in the RAW, this power DOES NOT require baring claws and fangs (any Kindred can do that). When purchased, players may opt for Freeze or Flee as a total success or leave it as it is in the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Entrancement: </strong>In addition to the active use of the power, the Kindred may add their Presence rating to all social rolls against single individuals. This supersedes the effects listed under Awe and Daunt.&nbsp;</p>
