<p>Disciplines: These are the vampire's supernatural abilities. Each Clan has three abilities associated with their bloodline; however, you can also acquire disciplines outside ones' bloodline. In the Rules As Written (RAW), this requires you find a teacher as well. The usage of disciplines and their abilities varies with each one. Of special note at the three "Physical" disciplines: Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence. Celerity allows a vampire to take multiple actions (without penalty) in a turn; Fortitude not only makes a vampire more resistant to normal damage but can even allow them to resist aggravated damage (like fire and sunlight); and Potence adds automatic successes to any&nbsp;Strength-related rolls.</p>
<p>Some Disciplines work automatically, or at least they do when conditions are met. Others require rolls of traits, the use of Blood Points, and / or Willpower points.</p>
<h3>Learning New Disciplines</h3>
<p>Clan Disciplines: Nearly all Clan Disciplines can be learned without finding a teacher, with certain exceptions (notably, some Thaumaturgical Paths require either extensive research or a teacher).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non Clan Disciplines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Physical disciplines - The disciplines of Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence are frequently referred to as the Physical disciplines. Any Kindred may learn these without having an instructor; however, they still count as Clan or non-Clan disciplines, as appropriate, for the purpose of experience point expenditure.</li>
  <li>All others - Learning any other non-Clan discipline requires a willing teacher. Generally, you can expect to owe a particularly large favor in return for the teaching of a non-Clan discipline.</li>
  <li>Special rules - Some disciplines are almost never taught to non-Clan members, such as Thaumaturgy. As well, some very rare Clan disciplines, like Flight, cannot be learned outside the Clan in which the discipline exists.</li>
</ul>
