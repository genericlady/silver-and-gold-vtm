When you are rolling to find out if you succeed at a task, the number of dice you have in your dice pool is primarily based on a trait or a combination of two traits. I will generally assign these based on circumstances; however, you may persuade me (especially if there was appropriate roleplaying) to use a different combination. Here are some examples of dice pool assignments (with associated difficulties) from the rulebook:

- You want to conduct yourself flawlessly at the governor’s formal dinner (and you can’t actually eat anything). Roll Dexterity + Etiquette (difficulty 8).
- You’re miles from your haven, and the sun will be up soon. Roll Wits + Survival (difficulty 7) to find shelter for the day.
- You try to distract the bodyguard with your left hand while surreptitiously slipping your knife back into your belt with your right. Roll Dexterity + Subterfuge (difficulty of the bodyguard’s Perception + Alertness).
- You lock eyes with the gang leader, trying to cow him into submission before his gang - of course, he wants to do the same to you. Make a Charisma + Intimidation roll, resisted by his Charisma + Intimidation.
- The ritual requires three days of nonstop chanting. Can you stay awake even through the daylight hours to finish it? Roll Stamina + Occult (difficulty 9).
- You need to board up the door to your haven in record speed - and it needs to be durable, too. Roll Wits + Crafts (difficulty 7).
- You’ve got access to the chantry library for exactly one night - you’d better find the name you want quickly, but there are a lot of books here. Roll Wits + Occult (difficulty 8) every hour; you need to achieve 15 successes.
- It’s not the message of the song, it’s how good you look singing it. Roll Appearance + Performance (difficulty 6) to have your choice of groupies.
- How long can you remain motionless in the bushes while the guards chat about the game? Roll Stamina + Stealth (difficulty 7). Each success allows you to hold still for one hour.
- It would be foolish to threaten your rival openly while in the confines of Elysium. Roll Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty 8) to properly veil your threat without leaving her in doubt as to your intentions.
- Can you distract the guard dogs while you slip in? Roll Manipulation + Animal Ken (difficulty 8).
- Did she just threaten you? Roll Perception + Intimidation (difficulty 5 ) to figure out what that Lick meant by that comment.
- You try to get his attention by driving your knife through his hand and into the oak bar. Roll Strength + Melee (difficulty 6).
- Whose story will the prince believe - yours or your enemy’s? Roll Manipulation + Expression, resisted by your rival’s Manipulation + Expression.
- You have to keep running if you’re going to outdistance your pursuers. Make an extended Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 7); if you collect 15 successes, you’ve outlasted them.
- You need to convince the judge to release you before the sun rises. Roll Charisma + Law (difficulty 8) to make a plea eloquent enough. 

Let's look at those last three examples. 

- You are trying to get the Prince to believe your story, but you know your rival is more articulate than you. You draw on your knowledge of the Occult to provide a supernatural basis for your story. Based on your description of your action and roleplay, you convince me to let you roll Manipulation + Occult.
- Your stamina is on the low side, but you are a quick thinker. Instead of trying to outlast your pursuers, you look for a place to make a couple of quick turns and then go to ground. Roll Wits + Athletics (its an urban environment, so Difficulty 5) to break line of sight; each success gives you 1 turn of unwatched movement. Then roll Dexterity + Stealth (resisted by your pursuers Perception + Alertness) to hide.
- What you lack in charm you make up for in looks. You try to make it clear to the judge that you'd be EVER so grateful for his indulgence: Roll Appearance + Subterfuge against his Wits + 5. (Normally, a seduction of this sort would be Wits + 3; however, doing it in court is more difficult than doing it at a bar.)
