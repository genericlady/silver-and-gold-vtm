Experience points, Chapters and Missions. 
At the end of each Chapter, which will usually mean "Mission," and which might be single play session or take multiple sessions, every character will normally receive from 1-8 experience points.
- 	You will get 1 point if you were present and participated throughout the mission. 
-		You may get between 1-3 points depending on the outcome of the chapter. A marginal succcess (or, depending on the circumstances, a draw) would get a single point, and spectacular outcome would get 3.
- 	You may get an additional 1-2 points for trying to do new things or pushing your limits, even if you failed. 
- 	You may get an additional 1-2 points for roleplaying, especially if you play your Demeanor, personal background, and the like.
Also, at the end of a chapter, each group can vote for its MVP; that is the player who worked hardest or did the most to further the group goals. That person receives 1 additional point. If no single player receives the most votes, no one receives the point.

Note that the "All-play" sessions generally bookend the Chapters; you usually won't receive XP in these sessions.

You can save and spend the experience poiints in accordance with the table below:

| Experience Point Costs |     |
| --- | --- |
| Trait | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| New Ability\* | 3   |
| New Secondary Ability\* | 2   |
| New Path\* | 7   |
| New Discipline\* | 10  |
| Attribute | current rating x 4 |
| Ability | current rating x 2 |
| Clan Discipline | current rating x 5 |
| Other Discipline | current rating x 7 |
| Secondary Ability | current rating  |
| Secondary Path | current rating x 4 |
| Virtue | current rating x 2 |
| Humanity | current rating x 2 |
| Willpower | current rating |
| \* You must find a teacher / instructor first. |     |

One thing you won't notice on the XP chart is the cost to obtain background traits and ranks (like Contacts, Herd, Resources (wealth), and Status). That's because you can only get these things through roleplay; and likewise, you can lose them the same way.

I reserve the right to prohibit the spending of points in an area that wasn't used at all over a prolonged period. For example, if you never once use Obfuscate over several game sessions, you may have to explain to me why I should allow you to put a point into it. Note that I may still allow it; you're just going to have to convince me more than if you'd been using it at least on occasion.Â
