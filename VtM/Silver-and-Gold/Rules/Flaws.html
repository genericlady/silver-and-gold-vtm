<h2>Physical</h2>
<p><strong>Hard of Hearing</strong> (1pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>Your hearing is defective. The difficulties of any rolls involving the use of hearing are increased by two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Short</strong> (1pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You are well below average height — four and a half feet (1.5 meters) tall or less. You have difficulty reaching or manipulating objects designed for normal adult size, and your running speed is one-half that of an average human.</p>
<p><strong>Dulled Bite </strong>(2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>For some reason your fangs never developed fully, or they may not have manifested at all. When feeding, you need to find some other method of making the blood flow. Failing that, you must achieve double the normal number of successes in order to make your bite penetrate properly. A number of Caitiff and high- Generation vampires often manifest this Flaw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Infectious Bite</strong> (2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You may not automatically lick the wounds of your feeding closed. In fact, your bites have a one in five chance of becoming infected and causing mortal victims to become seriously ill. The precise nature of the infection is determined by the Storyteller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>One Eye</strong> (2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You have only one eye — which eye is missing is up to you. The difficulties of all Perception rolls involving eyesight are increased by two, and the difficulties of all die rolls requiring depth perception are increased by one (this includes ranged combat).</p>
<p><strong>Open Wound</strong> (2 or 4pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You have one or more wounds that refuse to heal, and which constantly drip blood. This slow leakage costs you an extra blood point per evening (marked off just before dawn), in addition to drawing attention to you. If the wound is visible, you are at + 1 difficulty for all Social-based rolls. For two points, the Flaw is simply unsightly and has the basic effect mentioned above; for four points the seeping wound is serious or disfiguring and includes the effects of the Flaw Permanent Wound (below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Addiction </strong>(3pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You suffer from an addiction to a substance, which must now be present in the blood you drink (or you automatically frenzy, as per the Prey Exclusion Flaw). This can be alcohol, nicotine, hard drugs, or simply adrenaline. This substance always impairs you in some fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Glowing Eyes</strong> (3pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You have the stereotypical glowing eyes of vampire legend, which gives you a -1 difficulty on Intimidation rolls when you’re dealing with mortals. However, the tradeoffs are many; you must constantly disguise your condition (no, contacts don’t cut it); the glow impairs your vision and puts you at +1 difficulty on all sightbased rolls (including the use of ranged weapons); and the radiance emanating from your eye sockets makes it difficult to hide (+2 difficulty to Stealth rolls) in the dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lame </strong>(3pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>Your legs are damaged, which prevents you from running or walking easily. You are forced to walk with a cane or possibly leg braces, and you have a pronounced limp to your stride. Your walking speed is one-quarter that of a normal human, and running is impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lazy </strong>(3pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You are simply lazy, avoiding anything that requires effort on your part. Preferring to let others do the hard work, you lounge around. For any action that requires preparation, there’s a good chance you didn’t properly prepare. Difficulty rolls for spontaneous Physical actions (including combat, unless it’s part of a planned offensive) increase by one.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Healing</strong> (3pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You have difficulty healing wounds. It requires two blood points to heal one health level of bashing or lethal damage, and you heal one health level of aggravated damage every five days (plus the usual five blood points and Willpower expenditure).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Child</strong> (4pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>Most vampires begin their unlife in adulthood, but your sire, whether by necessity, cruelty, or peculiarity, Embraced you when you were a child. No matter how many years have passed, your body remains prepubescent. Your Strength and Stamina may not be higher than 2 and the difficulty of rolls to lead or command mortal adults increases by two.</p>
<p><strong>Deaf </strong>(4pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You cannot hear. While you may be more resistant to some applications of Dominate, you also may not listen to electronic or vocal media, and the difficulties of many Perception rolls are increased by three.</p>
<p><strong>Blind </strong>(6pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You cannot see. Characters can compensate for the loss of vision by becoming more attuned to other sensory input, but visual cues and images are lost to them. Difficulties of all Dexterity-based rolls are increased by two. Oddly, vampires with Aura Perception (Auspex 2) are still able to use this ability, thought the information is interpreted via the other senses. On the other hand, vampires who need make eye contact to enact powers like Dominate against you are only at a penalty to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Mental</h2>
<p><strong>Shy </strong>(1pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You are distinctly ill at ease when dealing with people and try to avoid social situations whenever possible. Difficulties for all rolls involving social interaction with strangers are increased by two. If the character becomes the center of attention in a large group, difficulties are increased by three.</p>
<p><strong>Lunacy </strong>(2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You are affected by the phases of the moon, increasing your chances to frenzy. Under the crescent moon, difficulties to avoid frenzy increase by one. Under the half or gibbous moon, difficulties rise by two. When the moon is full, difficulties increase by three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Phobia </strong>(2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You have an overpowering fear of something. Spiders, snakes, crowds, and heights are examples of common phobias. You must make a Courage roll every time you encounter the object of your fear. The difficulty of the roll is determined by the Storyteller. If you fail the roll, you must retreat from the object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Short Fuse</strong> (2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You are easily angered. Difficulties to avoid frenzy are two greater. Brujah vampires cannot take this Flaw, as they already suffer from a similar weakness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stereotype </strong>(2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You buy heavily into all of the vampire stories you’ve read and heard. You wear a cape or body glitter, speak with an accent, and otherwise act in a cartoonish fashion. Such behavior is embarrassing in the extreme to other Kindred, who are likely to ostracize or mock you (+2 difficulty to Social rolls with other vampires who don’t share your habits). You also stand out to hunters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Territorial </strong>(2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You are extremely territorial, staking out a particular area as your hunting ground and reacting aggressively to trespassers. If another vampire enters your territory uninvited, you must make a frenzy roll. If you fail, you immediately attack the interloper and continue attacking until the intruder is dead or has left your hunting grounds. You are reluctant to leave your territory except in desperate circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thirst for Innocence</strong> (2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>The sight of innocence — of any sort — arouses in you a terrible bloodlust. Roll Self-Control or Instincts, or else frenzy and attack the source of your hunger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vengeful </strong>(2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You have a score to settle, incurred either during your mortal days or after the Embrace. You are obsessed with taking your revenge on an individual or group, and it is your overriding priority in any situation where you encounter the object of your revenge. You may temporarily resist your need for vengeance by spending a Willpower point.</p>
<p><strong>Weak-Willed</strong> (3pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You are highly susceptible to Dominate and intimidation by others; Dominate attempts automatically affect you unless the Discipline wielder is of higher Generation, and your difficulties to resist Social abilities such as Intimidation or Leadership, as well as mind-altering spells or magic, are increased by two. Your Willpower Trait may never rise above 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conspicuous Consumption</strong> (4pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>It is not enough for you to draw nourishment from the blood of mortals — you believe you must also consume your victim’s heart, liver, and other blood-rich tissue. Of course, this will necessitate the deaths of all of your victims (unless you are extremely creative), which might lead to numerous problems with maintaining Humanity (and a low profile).</p>
<p><strong>Guilt-Wracked</strong> (4pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You simply cannot come to grips with the fact that you must drink blood to survive. You suffer horrible guilt over each time you feed (roll Conscience, difficulty 7, or else frenzy every time you feed (characters with the Conviction Virtue cannot take this Flaw) and try to avoid doing so as much as possible. This means that you rarely have much blood in your system, leaving you vulnerable to both attacks and hunger-based frenzies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flashbacks </strong>(6pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You managed to make it through the Creation Rites or other similarly traumatic experience, but not wholly intact. The most insignificant thing can throw you into a different mood or state of mind, and as such your behavior is extremely unpredictable. Because of your precarious emotional state, your Willpower fluctuates. At the beginning of each story, make a Willpower roll (you may not spend Willpower for an automatic success). If you succeed, you may participate in the story as normal. If you fail, however, your Willpower score is considered to be 1 for the duration of that session, and you only have one Willpower point to spend. You may roll again at the beginning of the next session to see if you regain your Willpower.</p>
<h2>Looks</h2>
<p><strong>Ugly </strong>(1pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>Subtract 1 from relevant Social dice pools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Repulsive</strong> (2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>Subtract 2 from relevant Social dice pools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Supernatural</h2>
<p><strong>Cast No Reflection </strong>(1pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You actually cast no reflection, just like the vampires of legend. This can have a detrimental effect when trying to pass as a human. Vampires of Clan Lasombra automatically have this Flaw (and you may be mistaken for one of them if you possess this).</p>
<p><strong>Touch of Frost </strong>(1pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>Plants wither as you approach and die at your touch. Your touch leeches heat from living beings, as though you were made of ice.</p>
<p><strong>Demon Hounded </strong>(1-5pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>A demon has taken a shine to you. It comes at odd and inconvenient hours and offers you bribes of wealth and power. Some days, it asks for favors; on others, it offers them. What black schemes does hell have in mind for you that one of its servants would bother you so? What fell powers have you toyed with that you should not? At 1 point, the demon is little more than an imp, asking for minor favors or stealing small objects. At 3 points, the demon is your physical or magical equal, or is a smaller threat that is willing to also drag your close friends into this affair. At 5 points, the demon is significantly powerful, able to threaten your coterie, or a lesser demon willing to torment your friends, family, and acquaintances.</p>
<p><strong>Beacon of the Unholy </strong>(2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You radiate palpable evil. Clergy and devout mortals know instinctively that there is something horribly wrong with you, and react accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Lord of the Flies</strong> (2pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>Buzzing harbingers of decay swirl around you everywhere. Their constant presence makes it difficult for you to interact socially (+1 difficulty when appropriate) and nearly impossible to sneak up on someone or hide effectively. The buzzing of the flies inevitably gives you away — all Stealth rolls are at +2 difficulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Repelled by Crosses</strong> (3pt. Flaw)</p>
<p>You are repelled by the sight of ordinary crosses, believing them to be symbols of holy might. When confronted by a cross, you must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 9) or flee from the symbol for the duration of the scene. If you botch the roll, not only must you attempt to flee, but the touch of the cross can cause aggravated damage (one health level of damage per turn that the cross touches your skin). This damage cannot be soaked, even if the vampire possesses Fortitude.</p>
