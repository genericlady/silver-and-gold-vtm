<p>Frenzy: Vampires who are struck by anger, hunger, or fear must deal with the urge to Frenzy. Vampires are not humans with a short temper, they are possessed (in possibly more than one sense) by an inner Beast. Even something as simple as one vampire threatening another, or a humiliating event, can provoke Frenzy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When on the verge of Frenzy, a vampire may resist Frenzy by making a Self-Control roll (remembering that your dice in this pool cannot exceed your current Blood Pool) against a target difficulty, usually ranging from 4 (malicious taunts) to 8 (outright humiliation), or alternatively, if committing a blatantly evil act that could result in the loss of Humanity, the difficulty is 9 minus Conscience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Completely overcoming the urge to Frenzy requires the accumulation of 5 successes; these can be made over time in an Extended roll. Each success delays Frenzy for but a single turn until all 5 are achieved or the stimulus is removed. Failure means the character enters Frenzy, going into a physical and emotional rampage, sating their hunger or attacking the object of their anger (or anyone / anything else if the offender is not accessible).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When in Frenzy, nothing matters other than the immediate gratification of the Beast's desires, and no act is too heinous (yes, that means you might end a Frenzy having to make a check to see if you lost Humanity). A player in Frenzy may use a Willpower point to control their character for a turn, but this does not stop the Frenzy, merely delays it. A character in Frenzy has a few benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are completely immune to dice pool penalties due to injury</li>
  <li>They are resistant to attempts to Dominate them (difficulty is increased by 2, difficulty to resist control is lowered by 2)</li>
  <li>They need not make Willpower rolls to accomplish feats</li>
  <li>They are immune to fear, even of fire and sunlight (unless fleeing in terror already)</li>
</ul>
<p>One slightly different type of Frenzy (referred to in the rules as RÃ¶tschreck) is provoked by fear instead of anger or hunger, the mechanics are the same other than rolling against Courage instead of Self-Control.</p>
<p>If your character is on a Path other then Humanity and has the Virtue of Instinct instead of Self-Control, anger and hunger Frenzies are handled differently (fear Frenzies are unchanged). If the Difficulty for the anger / hunger Frenzy check is less than or equal to the character's Instinct rating, they may freely choose to enter Frenzy or not. If the Difficulty is higher than their Instinct, they must enter Frenzy (there is no roll).</p>
<p>A Frenzy automatically ends when one of the following things happens:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The scene ends (this is the only way a Fear Frenzy automatically ends).</li>
  <li>For Anger Frenzies, the focus of the anger is utterly destroyed.</li>
  <li>For Hunger Frenzies, the Kindred's blood pool is completely full.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Frenzy may end when one of the following things happens</p>
<ul>
  <li>For Anger Frenzies, the focus of the anger is completely removed from the Kindred's presence AND they make a Self-Control roll against the same Difficulty as the original roll, unless modified by external events (e.g., trusted friends try to calm the Kindred).&nbsp;</li>
  <li>For Hunger Frenzies, a new Self-Control roll can be made if either:<ul>
      <li>They have killed a vessel during feeding, or</li>
      <li>They have fed during the Frenzy AND have at least (6 - Self Control) blood points in their pool.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For Fear Frenzies, they cannot at all perceive the object of their fear AND they have actually moved to a place that they believe to be completely safe AND they make a Courage roll.</li>
  <li>For any type of Frenzy, other situations may allow a new roll depending on the circumstances that provoked the Frenzy and the current situation.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In all cases, the same rules about needing to achieve 5 successes apply.</li>
</ul>
