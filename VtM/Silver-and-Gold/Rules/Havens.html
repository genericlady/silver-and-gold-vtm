<p>Havens are now based on three stats: Luxury, Security, and Size, and each one is tracked separately. If you have no dots in Luxury or Security, refer to the entry under "X". Note that the examples listed with each rating are just examples, and are not all-inclusive. Note also that you can have multiple havens. (Adapted from&nbsp;<a href="http://lastsanctum.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Haven_(v20_House_Rules)">http://lastsanctum.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Haven_(v20_House_Rules)</a>)<br>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Luxury</strong>: Luxury is a measure of the quality of appointments inside the haven. The level of Luxury ranges from spare to opulent. Luxury is capped by the characters Resources Background. In the case of a Communal Haven, Luxury is capped by the highest individual Resource level of the group's members. If a Haven is acquired in game that exceeds this cap, the Luxury rating will deteriorate over time through lack of maintenance.</p>
  <p>Dots  Description</p>
  <p>X    What passes for furniture probably fell off the back of a truck or was liberated from a dumpster.</p>
  <p>•     The place has been decorated and outfitted quite modestly. It has the basics but not much else. Furnishings may be older/used but in good condition, or new but of cheap manufacture.</p>
  <p>••    The haven offers relative comfort, with a host of amenities.</p>
  <p>•••   The haven is well-appointed. Furniture and furnishings are in good condition and are aesthetically pleasing.</p>
  <p>••••&nbsp; &nbsp; A luxurious oasis, everything in this haven is top-quality and was likely furnished by a professional designer.</p>
  <p>••••• Unique in both design and appearance, everything in this haven was custom designed or is an expensive antique / piefce of art.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Security</strong>: Security represents how tough it is to breach the haven. Each dot of Security either adds one to the difficulty of any roll made to penetrate the haven or adds one to the number of successes required to gain access. (Players and Storytellers should agree on this function before the story begins.)<br>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Dots  Description</p>
  <p>X    Cheap locks on the thin doors, but not much else.</p>
  <p>•     A solid door with a decent lock and double-paned locking windows.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>••    The haven is secure but not impenetrable, relying on a modern set of locks and physical protection such as bars over the windows.</p>
  <p>•••   Your haven is protected by all of the security features for the previous level and then some. It may be remote or accessed only by protected routes, such as a high-rise with a security guard who watches the elevator.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>••••  On par with restricted governmental buildings or even prisons, your haven has reinforced walls, sectionalized access throttles, and perhaps even several panic rooms or hidden chambers. You have invested a considerable about of time and effort to keep people out of your base.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>••••• Your base is protected by all of the security features offered by the previous levels. Additionally, it is protected by one or more unique features, such as being far off the beaten path, incorporating a geographical boundary like being built on an island, and/or possible occult protections, like being visible only to Kindred.<br>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Size</strong>: Size represents the amount of living space in the haven.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><br>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Dots  Description<br>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>•     A small apartment or underground chamber: 1 to 2 rooms.</p>
  <p>••    A large apartment or small family home; 3 to 4 rooms.</p>
  <p>•••   A warehouse, church, or large home; 5 to 8 rooms, or a large enclosure.</p>
  <p>••••  A mansion or network of tunnels; 9 - 15 rooms or chambers.</p>
  <p>••••• A sprawling estate or vast network of subway tunnels; 20+ rooms.<br>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don't have a permanent haven, dots in Allies or Resources can be used to acquire a regular Haven on an ad-hoc basis, dot for dot. These categories do not normally combine. In other words, if you have 3 dots in Resources, you can access a Haven worth 3 dots (like renting a hotel room that was equivalent to 1/1/1 for Luxury/Security/Size). Additionally, under certain circumstances, other Backgrounds may allow you access to a haven on an ad-hoc basis. For instance, if you have a domain, you may or may not be able to use the dots for an ad-hoc haven, depending on the type of domain (physical territory vs area of operations).</p>
