<p>Humanity / Path rating is one of the few traits that is measured from 1 to 10 by default (as opposed to 0 or 1 to 5). A vampire of Humanity 10 is more human than human (most mortals have the equivalent of Humanity 7); a vampire of Humanity 1 is nearly an incoherent animalistic wreak. A vampire that loses all Humanity (i.e., Humanity 0) is no longer a playable character; they are a ravening monster and forever lost. Humanity has a number of critical game effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Vampires with higher (closer to 10) Humanity or Path rating rise earlier in the evening; additionally, if forced to act during the daytime, a vampire's maximum dice pool is limited to their Humanity / Path.</li>
  <li>Dice rolls involving a vampire's virtues may not exceed their Humanity or Path rating, regardless the rating of the specific virtue; e.g, a Vampire with a Conscience of 5 but a Humanity of 3 is limited to adding 3 dice for their Conscience on any roll that uses it.</li>
  <li>Dice rolls involving social interactions with Humans and Kindred with Humanity have their Difficulty modified by exceptionally high or low Humanity / Path ratings:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>A vampire in Torpor (a state similar to hibernation) remains as such for a much longer time the lower their Humanity or Path rating.</li>
  <li>A vampire with low Humanity has difficulty passing as human (i.e., Blush of Life); they must spend a number of Blood Points equal to 8 - Humanity to appear fully human (i.e., breathing, flush skin, etc). A vampire with a Humanity of 8 or higher need not spend any points at all to accomplish this; they still do it naturally, even if long dead. Note that vampires not on the Path of Humanity <i>cannot</i> use Blush of Life.</li>
  <li>Humanity or Path rating can be lost whenever a character commits an act that violates their notion of humanity or moral code. At high levels of Humanity, this includes Selfish Thoughts (Humanity 10), Minor Selfish Acts (Humanity 9) and Injury (accidental or otherwise) to Another (Humanity 8). At low levels of Humanity, it takes something extreme to risk point loss, for example, Outright Murder or Savored Exsanguination (Humanity 3); or Thoughtless Killing or Feeding Unnecessarily (Humanity 2). Obviously, it can be difficult to retain very high Humanity, but its also more difficult to lose those final points before oblivion. If a character commits a morally questionable (relative to their current Humanity) act, they make a Conscience roll against a Difficulty of (6 plus 1 for each level of sin below the current, maximum of 9). A single success means they feel remorse for the action and retain their Humanity; a failure results in a lost point. A botch means that the character loses a point of Humanity, a point of Conscience, and gains a Derangement. Oh, and you can't spend a Willpower point for an automatic success on the roll; good luck!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Humanity and Violence</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fighting back when attacked only needs a check if you’re at Humanity 8+ (injury).</li>
  <li>Killing in self-defense needs a check at Humanity 6+ (accidental violation, because the death isn’t your intent; your survival is).</li>
  <li>Killing someone when you started the fight needs a check at Humanity 4+ (impassioned violation, because you wanted to hurt them, but it went too far).</li>
  <li>Coldblooded murder with purpose (i.e. you think they deserve to die for some reason) needs a check at Humanity 3+.</li>
  <li>Killing others for your own enjoyment is a roll even at Humanity 2.</li>
  <li>Torturing people to death for your own pleasure is a roll still made at Humanity 1 (Note: Mortals are incapable of losing their last point of humanity so this is the bottom of the barrel for humanity; guys like Jeffrey Dahmer).<br><br>Now, to also put those checks into perspective, your average person with Humanity 7 and Conscience 3 who kills someone in self-defense has a 66% of making their diff 8 Conscience check and remaining at Humanity 7. They feel guilty despite it being self-defense and stay connected to their humanity.<br><br>Even if they fail their conscience check, their Humanity only drops to 6 (slightly detached from humanity, as is commonly reported by those suffering PTSD after ending up in such a situation).<br><br>Realistically, a normal person would have to be confronted by situations involving killing in self-defense at least twice, and more likely half a dozen times, before their Humanity would drop to 5 and even if they killed in self-defense a thousand more times, they’d never drop to Humanity 4 because they’ve become desensitized to that level of killing.<br><br>Humanity 5 and even 4 has no effect on one’s bearing compared to Humanity 7. Also worth noting is that, if you’re a mortal, low humanity doesn’t really mean much mechanically. You’ll be more vulnerable to certain disciplines and humanity 3 or less will have higher difficulty on certain social tasks. But it doesn’t effect their sleep schedule or dice pools or anything.<br><br>It’s the fact that you’re a vampire that makes the Hierarchy of Sin matter. Because you AREN’T human. The Path of Humanity is a mask and tool to keep yourself from becoming a mindless predator.<br><br>Certain actions therefore matter MORE for maintaining a connection to humanity for a vampire than they do to an actual human.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Paths</h3>
<p>Not every path is practical for Camarilla vampires (or ones that wish to co-exist with them). The following is a list of Paths that are more likely to work within the Camarilla:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Humanity and its variants</li>
  <li>Path of Entelechy</li>
  <li>Road of Heaven and most of its variants (except Retribution)</li>
  <li>Road of Kings and most its variants (except Devaraja and Tyrant)</li>
  <li>Path of Honorable Accord&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Paths or the older Roads are certainly feasible; however, remember to note whether a Path uses different Virtues (as there is difference in game mechanics). Also, in addition to being full cognizant of the Hierarchy of Sins for an alternate Path, pay attention to the Ethics and Basic Beliefs of the Path. A cowardly character should not be on the Path of Entelechy; a character who's “Word of Honor” relies on the letter and not the spirit should not be on the Path of Honorable Accord.</p>
