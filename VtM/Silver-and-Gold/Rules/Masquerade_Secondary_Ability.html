<p><strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;This Talent cannot be taken during character generation, and is available only to vampires. Masquerade reflects how skilled a character is at appearing to be mortal: feigning respiration, creating a heartbeat, producing pink skin (by bringing blood to the surface), sneezing, masking vampiric tendencies, et al. Masquerade may be paired with a Social Attribute to determine whether the character successfully passes as a mortal among mortals.</p>
<p><strong>*Novice:</strong>&nbsp;You might succeed - in ideal circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>**Practiced:</strong>&nbsp;You are able to pass casual inspection.</p>
<p><strong>***Competent:</strong>&nbsp;You are undetectable under most normal circumstances.</p>
<p>****<strong>Expert:</strong>&nbsp;You may succeed even under duress.</p>
<p>*****<strong>Master:</strong>&nbsp;Even a witch-hunter would be fooled.</p>
<p><strong>Possessed by:</strong>&nbsp;Vampires</p>
<p><strong>Specialties:</strong>&nbsp;Breathing, Simulating Heartbeat, While Sleeping, Sneezing, Hiccups, Producing Skin Tone, Warming One's Skin</p>

<p>Okay, does this mean that I can purchase Masquerade and stop spending blood for Blush of Life? Yes, but there are several differences between the two methods of appearing to be still among the living. Remember that, assuming you are on the Path of Humanity, if you pay (8-Humanity) in Blood Points, you receive the Blush of Life for an entire scene. Alternatively, when you go to pay the blood point cost, you can choose to roll Humanity at Difficulty 8. Each success is an additional scene / hour (whichever is greater) that Blush of Life will continue. Failure simply means that your Blush of Life works only for this scene and you cannot roll again tonight (although you can still pay for additional uses). A botch is possible. For high Humanity Kindred, paying for Blush of Life is probably the best way to go.</p>
<p>The secondary talent "Masquerade," on the other hand, lets you buy the skill and avoid the blood cost. However, you do need to make a roll in order to appear human; it isn't automatic, and the number of successes you achieve matter. Generally, the roll will be Appearance + Masquerade; the Difficulty will normally be 6, although there are times when it will certainly be higher. If you only achieve a single success, then you may choose one item of human appearance (skin flush, breathing, normal body temperature, heartbeat). For each additional success, you can choose an additional item. If you achieve 5 or more successes, then you have achieved the equivalent of Blush of Life. Note that if you get 4 or fewer successes, then it is possible to see through your deception (for example, a medical examination might show a lack of capillary refill). This isn't true if you have 5 or more successes, nor is it true if you use Blush of Life.</p>
<p>There is one thing that Masquerade can do that Blush of Life cannot, and that is fake other elements of being alive. Want to appear to be eating and drinking at dinner with Kine? Manipulation + Masquerade. Did you just get caught with your fangs showing (literally or figuratively)? Wits + Masquerade to convince the Kine that what they saw wasn't what they saw. While you CAN roll the appropriate attribute + appropriate ability) to do the same thing, the difficulty is generally higher. For example, faking your participation at dinner would be Manipulation + Etiquette, but the Dif would be at least 7.</p>
<p>If you are low Humanity or on a different Path than Humanity, Masquerade can be an important Talent. If you have high Humanity, it may still be useful, but only in certain situations.</p>
