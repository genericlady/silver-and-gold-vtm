<p>Physical</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bruiser (1pt. Merit)</p>
<p>Your appearance is sufficiently thug-like to inspire fear (or at least disquiet) in those who see you. While you’re not necessarily ugly, you do radiate a quiet menace, to the point where people cross the street to avoidpassing near you. All Intimidation rolls against those who have not demonstrated their physical superiority to you are at -1 difficulty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Catlike Balance (1pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You possess an innately perfect sense of balance. Characters with this Merit reduce difficulties of all balance- related rolls (e.g., Dexterity + Athletics to walk along a narrow ledge) by two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crackshot (3pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You’ve trained extensively with firearms, to the point where the gun feels like an extension of your own hand. Spend a point of Willpower to make impressive trick shots. You still need to roll your Dexterity + Firearms if attacking someone. You can make bullets ricochet off a spittoon before hitting your target, shoot the lock off a door, or the cigarette out of someone’s mouth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Daredevil (3pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You are good at taking risks, and even better at surviving them. When attempting exceptionally risky non-combat actions (such as leaping from one moving car to another), characters with this Merit add an additional three dice to their rolls, and negate a single botch die that may result from such a roll. Generally, such actions must be at least difficulty 8 and have the potential to inflict at least three health levels of damage if failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Efficient Digestion (3pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You are able to draw more than the usual amount of nourishment from blood. When feeding, you gain an additional point to your blood pool for every two points of blood you consume. This does not allow you to exceed your blood pool maximum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huge Size (4pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You are abnormally large in size, at least 6’10” and 300 pounds in weight (well over two meters tall and over 130 kgs). Aside from making you extremely noticeable in public, this extra mass bestows an additional Bruised health level. Characters with this Merit may also gain bonuses to push objects, open barred doors, avoid being knocked down, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mental</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer Aptitude (2pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You are familiar with and talented in the uses of computer equipment. Other Kindred may not understand computers, but to you they are intuitive. All rolls involving computers are at -2 difficulty for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eidetic Memory (2pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You remember, with perfect detail, things you see and hear. Documents, photographs, conversations, etc., can be committed to memory with only minor concentration. Under stressful conditions involving numerous distractions, you must make a Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 6) to summon enough concentration to absorb what your senses detect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Natural Linguist (2pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You have a flair for languages. You may add three dice to any dice pool involving written or spoken languages, and each purchase of the Language Merit (previous page) gives you two languages instead of just one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iron Will (3pt. Merit)</p>
<p>When you are determined and your mind is set, nothing can thwart you from your goals. Characters using Dementation, Dominate, or any other mind-altering magic, spell, or Thaumaturgy path against your character are at +3 difficulty.</p>
<p>Elder levels of powers like Dementation and Dominate may overwhelm even this resistance. Against Level Six powers, the expenditure of a Willpower point through Iron Will only raises the difficulty of the Discipline roll by two. Against Level Seven powers, the difficulty is increased by only one. Level Eight and higher powers cannot be resisted with Iron Will.</p>
<p>This Merit does not affect Presence or other powers dealing with the emotions. Characters will Willpower scores below 8 cannot take this Merit.</p>
<p>Social</p>
<p><s>&nbsp;</s></p>
<p>Natural Leader (1pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You are gifted with a certain magnetism to which others naturally defer. You receive two extra dice when making Leadership rolls. You must have a Charisma rating of 3 or greater to purchase this Merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prestigious Sire (1pt. Merit)</p>
<p>Your sire has or had great status in her Sect or Clan, and this has accorded you a certain amount of prestige. Though your sire may no longer have any dealings with you, the simple fact of your ancestry has marked you forever. This prestige might aid you greatly in dealings with other vampires, or it might engender jealousy or contempt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Protégé (1pt. Merit)</p>
<p>Your sire watched you for some time before Embracing you, and spoke glowingly of you to acquaintances. These vampires may be inclined to look favorably on you by dint of your sire’s recommendation; you are at -1 difficulty on Social rolls with all those who’ve heard good things about you.</p>
<p><s>&nbsp;</s></p>
<p>Entrepreneur (2pt. Merit)</p>
<p>Making money comes naturally to you, and you know what it takes to succeed. All rolls involving acquiring money through business dealings have their difficulty reduced by 2.</p>
<p><s>&nbsp;</s></p>
<p>Arcane (1 to 5 pt. Merit)</p>
<p>Some vampires have a strange ability to slip from notice, which manifests as an aura of forgetfulness. Those trying to remember the vampire experience a sensation of jamais-vu. The ability may be deliberately developed, or the Kindred could simply be too ordinary to pay attention to. Though not similar to Obfuscate, Arcane doesn’t help in combat situations — the vampire can’t literally vanish. However, someone searching for them may well fail, as no one remembers the vampire or can give a reliable description.</p>
<p>Each point taken subtracts one die from any dice pools used to actively locate the vampire or recall her from memory. Those with this Merit can choose to “turn off” Arcane if they wish. As a passive trait, it doesn’t help on Stealth rolls or other overt attempts to hide. If you have any dots in Status or Fame, Arcane ceases to function while you possess them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paragon (7pt. Merit)</p>
<p>Others find you particularly compelling. Select one Background from the following group: Allies, Contacts, Domain, Fame, Herd, Influence, Mentor, Resources, Retainers, or Status. You receive one free dot in that Background, and your maximum Trait score in that Background may exceed normal Generational limits by one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Supernatural</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inoffensive to Animals (1pt. Merit)</p>
<p>With rare exceptions, animals usually despise the Kindred. Some flee, others attack, but all dislike being in the presence of a vampire. You have no such problem. Animals may not enjoy being in your company, but they don’t actively flee from you.</p>
<p><s>&nbsp;</s></p>
<p>Hidden Diablerie (3pt. Merit)</p>
<p>The tell-tale black streaks of diablerie do not manifest in your aura.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lucky (3pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You were born lucky — or else the Devil looks after his own. Either way, you may repeat any three failed rolls per story, including botches, but you may try only once per failed roll.</p>
<p><s>&nbsp;</s></p>
<p>Spirit Mentor (3pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You have a ghostly companion and guide. The identity and exact powers of this spirit are up to the Storyteller, but it can be called upon in difficult situations for help and guidance.</p>
<p><s>&nbsp;</s></p>
<p>Profane Trappings (4 pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You befoul everything you touch. Whether through intent or unfortunate happenstance, your Domain, Retainers, Herd, and trappings are all tainted with the unholy. While this pollutes your surroundings with a constant aura of nausea and unease, it does make any infernal acts easier to perform in their presence. By taking this Merit, any Disciplines you use are considered infernal; at the Storyteller’s discretion, using your Disciplines on land you hold, on servants in your employ, or with objects you possess, reduces the difficulty of the roll by –2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True Love (4pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You have discovered, perhaps too late, a true love. He or she is mortal, but is the center of your existence, and inspires you to keep going in a world of darkness and despair. Whenever you suffer, the thought of your true love gives you the strength to persevere. This Merit grants you one automatic success on all Willpower rolls, which can be negated only by a botch die. This can be a great gift but also a hindrance, for your true love may require protection and occasionally rescue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional Discipline (5pt. Merit)</p>
<p>You can take one additional Discipline (Storyteller discretion) as if it were a Clan Discipline. All costs to learn that Discipline are paid out as if it were native to your Clan. A character cannot take this Merit more than once, and Caitiff vampires cannot take this Merit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demonic Patron (5 pt. Merit)</p>
<p>Your actions drew the attention of a demonic entity. Maybe you deliberately sought it as a means to gain power, or perhaps it wheedled its way into your existence and now won’t let go. The entity became a patron of yours, offering guidance when sought and assistance against your foes. One night it will turn on you and demand something. You will be unable to refuse its request. Until that time, your patron counts as three dots in Mentor and two dots in Allies.</p>
