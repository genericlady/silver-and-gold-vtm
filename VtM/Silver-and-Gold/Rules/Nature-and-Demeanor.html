<p>Nature and Demeanor: Every character has a true nature, which describes them as they actually are, and a demeanor, which is the face they present to the world. One's nature may be the same as one's demeanor, similar, or completely different. Keeping one's nature is normally a secret from all but one's most trusted confidants (and maybe not even them); consider that if others know your true nature (and in game sense, how you regain Willpower), they have information that could be used against you.</p>
<p>Over time, one's Demeanor can change; however, Nature almost never does.</p>
<p>It is important to remember both Nature and Demeanor; remember that if you act according to your Nature, you may regain Willpower points; always bring such acts to the Storyteller's attention, secretly or otherwise. Roleplaying your Demeanor can net you bonus Experience Points.</p>
