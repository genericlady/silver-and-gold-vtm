<p>Automatic success vs rolled attempts and bending the rules (ex. Dominate): In the RAW, if you can have an automatic success (for example, by having more dice in your pool than the target Difficulty), you can always choose instead to roll and get a better than marginal success. As a house rule, I apply this to the boundaries set with traits, including disciplines. For example, if you have ever seen the movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula, there is a scene in which Dracula wants Mena Harker to see him across a crowded street. He looks at her (ignoring that we don't see him catch her eye) and says, "See me." This is very similar to the first level of Dominate, which is also very like the D&amp;D cleric spell, Command. Dominate allows the vampire to give a one word command and have it obeyed. The command can be contained in a sentence, but in the RAW, only the single word is the one that counts. However, our house rule allows you to roll for success (or spend a Willpower point) in order to push the boundaries of this. The number of successes you need is dependent on the circumstances; in the example given, the verb "see" is routinely followed by an object; thus, I would likely only require a single additional success to have the desired effect.</p>
<p>Note that if you have an automatic success and you choose to roll in order to “bend the rules” on a power, you risk losing that success. This supersedes the rule that the success from the use of Willpower can never be removed by a rolling a 1.</p>
