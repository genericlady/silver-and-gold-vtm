<p>Willpower: Willpower measures the vampire's inner drive and confidence. It is measured on a scale from 0 to 10 and has both a rating (which rarely changes) and a pool of useful points, which can be gained (up to the rated maximum) and lost. Willpower rolls are made against the rating, regardless of the number of points in the pool. A character can empty their entire pool, which means that they are mentally, physically, and spiritually exhausted, and can only act with great difficulty.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Willpower points can be spent in the following ways:<ul>
      <li>As noted, a single point can be spent in a turn on a single action to give the character one automatic (and guaranteed) success. There a very few actions that can't use Willpower in this way; in most cases, if you concentrate and really exert yourself (by spending a Willpower point), you can succeed. You must announce that you spending a Willpower point *before* you roll--you can't concentrate on a task after the fact! (Also as noted, rolling to prevent Humanity loss is one of the few times where you cannot use a Willpower point.)</li>
      <li>If a character would take an instinct action, like leaping away from sunlight suddenly pouring in through a previously dark window, you can usually spend a Willpower point to avoid taking this reflexive action.</li>
      <li>If you have a Derangement, you can spend a Willpower point to avoid having it manifest in a scene.</li>
      <li>Spending a Willpower point will allow you to ignore wound penalties for a single turn; unless you are incapacitated or in Torpor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Willpower points spent may be regained as follows:<ul>
      <li>At the end of a Story (not a game session or chapter/mission), a character's Willpower pool is usually fully replenished.</li>
      <li>If a character attains some extraordinary goal, the Storyteller may reward them with a Willpower point for their pool.</li>
      <li>A character who behaves according to their Nature in a particularly notable manner will receive a point of Willpower for their pool. Truly exceptional acts may garner two or even three points.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
