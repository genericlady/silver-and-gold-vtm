**Can you get your Trait (Attribute and Ability) ratings above 5?** Yes, although it's easier for some things than others. The maximum number of dots you can have in almost any trait is 9, unless you are an Antediluvian or the equivalent (hello Diablerie!). However, for Physical Attributes only (STR/DEX/STA), you can have an effective rating much higher; all the way to a maximum of 19. This is due to the vampiric Disciplines of Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence and the ability to spend Blood Points to increase your Attribute all the way to 10. 

**Can you get your Discipline ratings above 5?** Yes. However, it is generally impossible for anyone other than an Antediluvian (that's a 3^rd^ Generation Vampire) to have a rating of 10 in a Discipline. 

**What does it mean to have a trait that is higher than 5?** What about higher than 10 (for the Physical Attributes)?

|     |     |     |     |     |     |

  
**What about abilities (Talents, Skills, and Knowledges)?** There aren't any special feats with them, but as always, at 4 dots you get to pick a specialty. You can pick another at 6 and 8 dots.

1 dot - I have it.  
2 dots - I can use it.  
3 dots - I can teach it.  
4 dots - I can make a living by doing it and I'm well-respected at it. (Pick a specialization)   
5 dots - I am one of the world's best at it.  
6 dots - People tell legends about me and even the exaggerations aren't too far from the truth. I am currently the best in the world. (Pick a second specialization.)  
7 dots - The word people use to describe it is probably my name.  
8 dots - I am the best of all time. (Pick a third specialization.)  
9 dots - People aren't sure I actually exist, my prowess is so unbelievable.
