# Secondary Abilities

Secondary Abilities are specializations of Primary Abilities (Talents, Skills, and Knowledges). They are acquired the same way as primary abilities, with the following notes:

- At character creations, they cost 2 Freebie points per dot, the same as other abilities.
- During the game, they cost 2 XP to acquire a new ability. Each additional dot costs the Current Rating in XP.
- Skill checks made using a Secondary ability are usually made at -1 Difficulty.

Question: How do secondary abilities, like Public Speaking, work, and why would I take them?

Public Speaking, a Secondary Talent, is a subset of the Primary Talent, Expression. Here's the explanation for Expression from the V20 rulebook:
This is your ability to get your point across clearly, whether through conversation, poetry, or even in 140 characters or fewer. Characters with high Expression can phrase their opinions or beliefs in a manner that cannot be ignored (even if their opinions are misinformed or worthless). They might also be talented actors, skilled at conveying moods or communicating emotion with every gesture. Additionally, this Talent represents your ability for poetry, creative writing, or other literary art forms. For many elders, Expression is the subtle art of crafting a satirical epigram capable of socially crippling one’s longtime rival. For younger Kindred, Expression may well be the key to convincing thirty stake-wielding Anarchs to converge on the Sheriff’s private hunting ground with the right text message.
​Secondary abilities are almost always a more specific form of a primary ability. For example, the Secondary Skill "Dancing" is a subset of the Primary Skill "Performance." Keep in mind that categories (Talents/Skills/Knowledges) sometimes differ; for instance, if you were shooting a bow and arrow, you would use the Primary Talent of "Athletics," unless you had the Secondary Skill of "Archery.

As you know, if you have four or more dots in any trait, you can specialize that trait. You might wonder what the difference is between specializing a primary ability, like Expression, with taking a secondary ability like Public Speaking. There are three main differences:
You generally get no benefit from specializing a trait until you have at least four dots in that trait; a secondary ability is useful even with a single dot.
Having a specialization means that you can reroll any 10s (keeping the successes) whenever doing something with that specialization; having a secondary ability means that your rolls are at a lower (usually -1) difficulty.
It is cheaper in experience points to raise secondary abilities than it is to raise primary abilities. 
Here's an example of what I mean. Let's look at two characters. One (Jack) takes the Primary Talent "Expression" and the other (Jill) takes the Secondary Ability "Public Speaking." 

Jack spends 3 XP to acquire Expression. It will cost him (the current rating x 2) to raise it, so to raise it from 1 dot to 2 dots costs 2 XP. To raise it from 2 to 3 costs 4 XP. To raise it to 4 dots will cost him 6 XP. At 4 dots, he can specialize the Talent, and he does, taking the Specialization "Public Speaking." Total cost, 15 XP.

Jill spends 2 XP to acquire Public Speaking. It costs her (the current rating) to raise it, so going from 1 dot to 2 costs only 1 XP. 2 to 3 costs 2 XP, and 3 to 4 costs 3 XP. At 4 dots, she can also take a specialization, and she does, "Impromptu Speeches." Total cost, 8 XP.

During the game, Jack and Jill are both giving speeches to an angry crowd and trying to calm them down. I tell them the roll is Charisma + Expression, Difficulty 8, and they will need a complete success (3 successes) to keep the crowd from killing them. Jill asks if she can use her Secondary Talent of Public Speaking instead, which obviously she can. That means that Jill will make her roll at Difficulty 7 instead of 8. For the sake of this example, they roll identically (they both have 3 Charisma).
(7+5+10+9+5+1+6)
For Jack, this gives him 1 success (Difficulty 8, the 9 and 10 are successes but the 1 cancels one of them out). He points out that he rolled a 10 and he specializes in Public Speaking, which means he gets to reroll the 10 (keeping that success) and trying to get an additional success. He rolls a "7" and fails. Jack has only 1 success and starts getting pummeled. 
For Jill, this same roll gives her 2 successes (Difficulty 7, the 7, 9, and 10 are successes but the 1 cancels one of them out). She points out that this speech was improvised and that she has a specialization (in her secondary ability) of "impromptu speeches;" thus, she also gets to reroll the 10, and this time that same "7" is an additional success, giving her 3 successes total. Jill wins!

Sounds great, right? Okay, but the very next night, the Prince wants our characters to write a speech for him. This time, I say the roll is Intelligence + Expression, and the Difficulty is 6. It will take 5 successes to write a speech that makes the Prince truly happy. Both our characters have 3 Intelligence. Each roll takes an hour, and they have four hours to write the speech.
Jack gets to roll 7 Dice. Jill will only get to roll 3. Why? Because Jack's primary talent of Expression encompasses more than personally delivering a oratory; it includes most forms of literary art. Jill's secondary talent doesn't. (Alternatively, Jill could try to convince me to let her use the secondary ability, but in this case I would probably rule against it, as secondary abilities are supposed to be limiting. If I did​ allow it, I would definitely raise the difficulty by 2.)

The dice come up as 
(7+5+10+9+5+1+6)

(1+6+6+8+6+9+10)

For Jack, this means that by the second roll, he's achieved a cumulative 9 successes. It took him two hours, but he's crafted a terrific speech. Well done!
For Jill, using the same rolls in sequence but only three at a time, the first hour nets Jill 2 successes (7, 10). She doesn't get to roll again for the 10, as her specialization is unrelated to the task. The second roll gets zero succeses (9 succeeds, but 1 takes away that success). However, she still has 2 successes banked, which she won't lose unless she botches. The third roll (which is the third hour!), she nets a single success (6 and 6 but also 1), giving her a cumulative total of 3 successes. In her fourth and final hour, Jill gets 3 successes, giving her a combined total of 6. Not bad, but Jack turned in his speech two hours earlier and it's qualitatively better. The Prince reads Jack's speech at the Conclave.
