<p>Any game of Vampire has elements of deception in it, and this chronicle is no different. Players are encouraged to make deals, lies, engage in acts of rumor and innuendo, and the like, whether in game or outside of the game (only pertaining to their in-game characters, of course). However, it should be noted that anything that includes me (as the Storyteller / GM) becomes “canon” within the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if Wanda and Natasha, in a private email, pledge their characters' allegiance to each other, but don't include me in the chain, and then in-game, Wanda's character claims offense for Natasha's inevitable betrayal--which of course, Natasha denies--I will give neither side credence. Even if, after the fact, Wanda sends me “proof”, I will not make a retroactive correction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Steve and Tony make a similar agreement, but one of them includes me in the email chain or adds me at the end just for the agreement part, I will take notice of it, and when Steve calls foul when Tony fails to live up to his end, I will agree that a deal did in fact exist. Note that I still won't take any sides in this dispute; I merely will confirm that the gods did indeed take note.</p>
<p>Of course, one person might decide to take an otherwise private conversation and send it to me; however, when notified of an agreement or arrangement between two or more parties, I will send confirmation of my understanding of that deal to all those that agreed to said deal. The gods notice everything or nothing.&nbsp;</p>
